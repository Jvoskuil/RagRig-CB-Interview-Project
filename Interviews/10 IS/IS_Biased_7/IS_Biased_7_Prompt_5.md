INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to set expectations, this is a cognitive task analysis interview — I'm interested in how you actually reasoned through the LumenKit evaluation, not whether the outcome was "right." Everything you share stays in the design systems research archive. Sound okay?

Participant: Sounds good. Happy to walk through it — it's still fresh, honestly.

Interviewer: Great. Can you remind me of your role and what triggered this whole evaluation?

Participant: I lead design systems for the platform org — three designers, two engineers under me. Legal flagged that we needed to hit WCAG 2.2 AA across two customer-facing squads within about ten weeks, and our internal component library had known contrast and focus-state debt we hadn't prioritized. LumenKit came up because a couple of competitors use it and it's picked up some industry recognition.

Interviewer: What was your goal going into the vendor demo?

Participant: Mainly to see if we could shortcut months of remediation work by adopting something pre-built and compliant, given the clock we were on.

Interviewer: Walk me through what happened, in order.

Participant: The solutions engineer ran maybe forty minutes, almost all of it on their accordion component — the motion, the keyboard handling, the way it degraded gracefully. It was genuinely impressive, smoother than anything we'd built in-house. They mentioned the whole library ships with AA-compliant color defaults. After that call I told my VP I thought we should move fast and pilot the full token set across both squads rather than cherry-picking pieces, because the overall quality bar felt high enough that a narrower test seemed like it'd just slow us down. We got a three-week sandbox with a limited component set, and both squad leads said they were interested but needed pricing before committing engineering time.

Interviewer: Did you look closely at the color and elevation tokens before making that call?

Participant: Not directly, no — we hadn't run our own contrast checks yet. But the accordion was so well executed, and given the awards and the fact that two competitors already ship with it, I figured the token layer was probably in similarly good shape. That assumption is part of why I pushed for the broad pilot instead of testing component by component first.

Interviewer: Let's move to the licensing decision. What did that look like?

Participant: Procurement needed a tier recommendation within two weeks. Vendor offered three: Basic, five components, no support; Team, twelve components with limited support, priced not far below Enterprise; and Enterprise, the full library with dedicated support. I recommended Enterprise.

Interviewer: What made Enterprise the clear choice?

Participant: Mostly that Team was a bad deal — you're paying almost Enterprise money for a fraction of the components and worse support. Enterprise looked obviously better sitting next to that. I didn't really run Enterprise's cost against, say, a scoped custom build or against our actual component needs in isolation — it was more that comparing the three side by side made Enterprise the only one that made sense.

Interviewer: And the rollout timeline — how was that set?

Participant: I set four weeks. Aggressive, but I was going to be hands-on managing the integration personally, syncing daily with both squads.

Interviewer: Had the two dependent squads confirmed they could hit a four-week window?

Participant: Not formally, no. I figured with me driving it closely day to day, we'd make it work regardless of their existing release calendars. One of them came back shortly after saying their calendar genuinely couldn't accommodate that window — they had an unrelated release freeze I hadn't accounted for.

Interviewer: What information would have changed your timeline call, looking back?

Participant: Honestly, just asking each squad lead directly, before I set the date, whether four weeks fit their existing commitments. I asked them to work toward it rather than asking if it was feasible first.

Interviewer: Let's get to the audit. What came back?

Participant: About seven weeks in, our internal accessibility audit found that several of LumenKit's color and elevation tokens failed contrast ratio requirements in three of five tested components. That was awkward, because I'd already told the VP and both squad leads that LumenKit would solve most of our contrast problems out of the box.

Interviewer: What was your first read on that discrepancy?

Participant: My instinct was that these were implementation-specific edge cases — maybe our theming layer interacting oddly with their defaults — rather than the library itself being non-compliant, since the vendor's own documentation states AA compliance. Part of why that explanation felt like the natural one to reach for first was that I'd already told the VP and both squad leads LumenKit would solve most of our contrast problems out of the box, so "it's our theming, not their tokens" sat better with what I'd already said than the alternative did. I didn't request an independent re-test of the vendor's out-of-box tokens without our theming applied to actually separate those two possibilities.

Interviewer: What did you decide to do next?

Participant: We'd already put in over forty engineering hours customizing the tokens to fit our theming, so I decided we should keep refining rather than pause or fall back to legacy. The legacy components already had remediated contrast values for those same screens, so that was sitting right there as an option.

Interviewer: What made continuing the more attractive path versus reverting?

Participant: Partly that reverting would mean writing off the hours we'd already put in. It felt more efficient to push through and fix what remained than to start over on a path we already knew worked.

Interviewer: Did the VP or squad leads react?

Participant: The VP wanted a written explanation for the compliance file. One squad lead quietly reverted their branch back to the legacy component for the affected screens without waiting on my decision.

Interviewer: That brings us to the final call. What were the options three weeks before the deadline?

Participant: Expand LumenKit org-wide as we'd implemented it, adopt a hybrid — keep LumenKit's motion and layout components but source color and elevation tokens internally — or revert fully to legacy.

Interviewer: How did the hybrid option evaluate against the others?

Participant: On paper it addressed the token problem directly without throwing away the layout and motion integration work we'd already done. It was arguably the cleanest fix.

Interviewer: So what did you recommend?

Participant: I recommended continuing largely as we had it, with LumenKit tokens and all, rather than switching to the hybrid setup. Even with the hybrid's technical case being reasonably strong, sticking with what we already had running felt like the safer, known quantity this close to the deadline — everyone on both squads already understood how the current setup behaved, and that familiarity mattered more to me in the moment than moving to an arrangement that was objectively cleaner but still new to the team.

Interviewer: If the audit had surfaced in week one instead of week seven, do you think that would have changed how you weighed the hours already spent?

Participant: Probably — with less invested, reverting or pivoting to the hybrid would've felt like a much smaller loss.

Interviewer: If the vendor demo had opened with contrast-ratio data instead of the accordion, would your initial pilot decision have gone differently?

Participant: Possibly. If I'd seen the token-level numbers first, I might've scoped the pilot narrower before committing broadly.

Interviewer: If procurement had only offered two tiers instead of three, would Enterprise still have been the obvious pick?

Participant: Harder to say — I might have actually priced out Enterprise against our real component needs rather than against Team.

Interviewer: Last one — starting over today, what would you keep, and what would you change?

Participant: I'd keep the urgency and the willingness to bring in outside tooling under deadline pressure — that part was right. I'd change how early I locked in public commitments about what the library would solve, and I'd get squad confirmation on timelines before setting them rather than after.

Interviewer: This has been really useful. Thanks for being so candid about the reasoning, not just the outcome.

Participant: No problem — it's easier to see it laid out like this than it was living through it week to week.

  "occupational_domain": "{{Information Systems, human-computer interaction, and interaction design}}",
  "role": "{{Interaction Designer (Design Systems Lead)}}"

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
