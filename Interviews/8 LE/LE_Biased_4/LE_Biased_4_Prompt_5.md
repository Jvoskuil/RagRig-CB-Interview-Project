INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this is a routine case-review interview for our lab's cognitive task analysis project — we're documenting how analysts actually reason through casework, not evaluating your performance. Everything's de-identified before it goes anywhere. Okay if we record and talk through a recent case?

Participant: Sure, that's fine. Which case did you want to walk through?

Interviewer: The windowsill swab from the burglary-assault — the one that went to a bail hearing a few months back. Can you start by telling me how it landed on your bench?

Participant: It came in as a rush request. Patrol had picked up a guy about two blocks from the house maybe forty minutes after the call came in — broken window, homeowner had a cut on his arm from being shoved into a doorframe during the break-in. The detective's submission note said the suspect had a prior burglary conviction and that he was, in his words, "almost certainly good for it." The swab itself was blood and touch DNA off the broken windowsill glass. Quantity came back under 100 picograms on quant, so I knew going in this was going to be a low-template situation — lots of stochastic effects, peak height imbalance, that kind of thing.

Interviewer: What was your objective at that point?

Participant: Determine whether the suspect could be included as a contributor to that mixture, generate a likelihood ratio if the data supported one, and get a technically defensible report out. We had a 24-hour turnaround because the DA wanted it ahead of the bail hearing. And logistically, my supervisor was the only technical reviewer available that week, so whatever I produced, she'd be the one signing off, fast.

Interviewer: Let's reconstruct the sequence. What happened first?

Participant: I pulled the case file to set up my analysis parameters — stochastic threshold, amplification target, all standard. Before I got to the profile itself, I read through the detective's cover note and the submission form, which already had the suspect's name and known profile listed. Then I ran the amplification. Came back partial — several peaks near the stochastic threshold, which is typical for that DNA quantity. I built out the allele table, flagged the ambiguous loci, and moved into the comparison stage. A few days later the victim called back and mentioned an ex-boyfriend had been in the house three days before the break-in, and a delivery driver had been at the door earlier that week. That complicated the elimination picture, since we'd only swabbed the homeowner. I finished the report and sent it up for technical review the night before the hearing.

Interviewer: Let's slow down at that first step — reading the file before setting up the analysis. Walk me through what was going through your mind.

Participant: Honestly, it's just how intake works. You read the submission form, you see what the detective knows, you set your parameters. The note stood out because it was pretty confident — "found two blocks away," "almost certainly good for it." I remember thinking, okay, this is probably him, let's see if the DNA backs that up. So when I sat down with the electropherogram, I was looking at it as, does this data support what we've already got on this guy, rather than starting cold and asking who could this mixture belong to.

Interviewer: Did you consider setting parameters before reading the narrative part of the note?

Participant: Not really — the form comes as one packet. I suppose I could've separated the suspect information from the case narrative and looked at the profile blind first, then compared. I didn't do that here. In hindsight I'm not sure it would've changed the amplification parameters themselves, but it probably shaped how I was thinking about the comparison before I even looked at a single peak.

Interviewer: Let's go to the electropherogram itself. What did you see, and how did you write it up?

Participant: There were several loci where the peaks lined up cleanly with the suspect's known profile, right where you'd expect them, above threshold. I spent a good amount of time on those — peak heights, confirming they weren't stutter, checking the ratios. But there were also two loci where alleles I'd have expected from him were missing or sitting below threshold, and one locus had an extra peak I couldn't immediately place. Those went into the notes, but more as a line — "inconclusive due to low template" — rather than something I dug into the way I dug into the matching loci.

Interviewer: What made you treat those differently?

Participant: Partly it's just efficiency — the matching loci are easy to describe, they're clean. The missing and extra peaks are messier, and with low-template DNA, you do get dropout and occasional artifact peaks, so logging them as inconclusive isn't unusual practice. But if I'm being honest, I probably gave the matching data more narrative attention because it was doing more work for the story I was building, and the messy stuff got less airtime, not because it was less real.

Interviewer: Later, the victim mentions two other people who'd been in the house. What did you do with that?

Participant: That came in after I'd already built most of the comparison. We only had the homeowner's elimination sample at that point. I flagged internally that the ex-boyfriend and delivery driver were unsampled, but I didn't request rush swabs from either of them. Partly that's the deadline — the hearing was the next morning, there wasn't time to get new elimination samples processed. But I also remember thinking the suspect profile already fit well enough that chasing two more elimination samples felt like it would just confirm what we already had.

Interviewer: How did you weigh the suspect-inclusion hypothesis against those alternative sources?

Participant: I accepted the suspect as a plausible contributor based on the partial match we had — I didn't require additional testing to feel comfortable with that. For the ex-boyfriend or the driver, though, my instinct was that without their samples, there was no real basis to seriously entertain them, so I treated that as an open question for someone else to chase, not something that needed to hold up the report. Looking back, I didn't apply quite the same bar to both sides — the suspect got in on a partial match, but the alternatives needed a full sample before I'd take them seriously at all.

Interviewer: Is there a version of this where you'd have paused the report instead?

Participant: If the deadline had been longer, yeah, I think I'd have pushed for rush swabs on both of them before finalizing anything.

Interviewer: Let's talk about the final report. The likelihood ratio came back moderate, not overwhelming. How did that shape the writing?

Participant: Right, it wasn't a slam-dunk statistic on its own. But by that point I had the proximity — suspect found two blocks away shortly after the call — and his prior conviction sitting in the file too. When I wrote the narrative section, I pulled those together with the DNA finding into one account: the profile is consistent with him, he was near the scene, he's done this before. Read together it feels like a solid picture. My supervisor reviewed it quickly given her own deadline and signed off without flagging the open items — the missing alleles, the unsampled alternatives — as things that needed more work first.

Interviewer: Did you consider presenting the statistical result separately from those other facts?

Participant: I didn't, really. It felt more useful to the DA's office to have it all in one coherent narrative rather than a dry, hedged statistic sitting by itself. Later, during cross-examination, the defense made a point of separating them back out — saying the DNA evidence alone was moderate, and it was really the narrative framing that made it sound stronger than the number supported. That stung a little, but I don't think what I wrote was inaccurate exactly.

Interviewer: If the detective's note hadn't named a suspect before you started typing the sample, do you think you'd have approached the electropherogram differently?

Participant: Possibly. I might've gone in more neutral, treating it purely as an unknown mixture, and maybe I'd have spent as much time on the missing alleles as the matching ones, since there'd be no name pulling my attention toward one profile over another.

Interviewer: And if the ex-boyfriend and delivery driver's elimination samples had come back before the deadline?

Participant: If either of them had matched better than the suspect did, that would've changed everything about how I wrote the conclusion. I just didn't have that data in time, and I made a call with what I had.

Interviewer: Last one — anything you'd want to redo, given what you know now?

Participant: I'd want to look at the electropherogram before reading the detective's narrative, just to see if my read changes. And I'd push harder for those elimination samples even under time pressure, rather than letting the deadline decide that for me.

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{LE_Biased_4}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Law enforcement}}",
  "role": "{{DNA Forensic Analyst}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
