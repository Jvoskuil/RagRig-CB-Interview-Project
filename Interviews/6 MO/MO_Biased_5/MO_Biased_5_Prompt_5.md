INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Before we start, I want to confirm you're comfortable walking through the turbocharger incident from your last contract, and that this is just for internal review purposes—nothing punitive.

Participant: Sure, no problem. Happy to go through it.

Interviewer: Can you set the scene for me—what vessel, what voyage, and what was your role at the time?

Participant: I was Chief Engineer on a geared bulk carrier, mid-size, about 55,000 deadweight. We were on a laden leg, roughly 30 hours out from the discharge port. My job was running the engine room day to day—main engine, auxiliaries, all the monitoring. We'd just come off a turbocharger overhaul on the main engine, done about three weeks prior at a yard stop. It wasn't cheap, and the office had been asking for updates on it, so it was very much front of mind.

Interviewer: Take me through what happened, from the first sign of trouble to how it eventually got resolved.

Participant: About two days into that leg, I noticed the exhaust gas temperature on one unit was running a touch high, and there was a bit more vibration on the turbocharger casing than I'd expect. Nothing alarming—still inside the normal band, no alarm triggered. Given we'd literally just had that unit stripped and rebuilt, my first read was that it was probably just bedding in, maybe slightly different clearances after the overhaul. I kept an eye on it rather than pulling back on load, because we had a tide-restricted berth waiting for us and reducing speed then would have put that window at risk. The readings actually settled down over the next few hours, so at the time it felt like the right call.

A day or so later, the monitoring system was showing everything back in the green—temperatures, scavenge air pressure, all nominal. I didn't have my second engineer pull a lube oil sample at that point. The system was telling me it was fine, and honestly that's what it's there for. We left it at that and planned to look at it properly at the next scheduled maintenance.

Then, maybe twelve hours before that, my second engineer had flagged during rounds that the fuel filter differential pressure had crept up a bit. I was pretty focused on the turbocharger numbers at that point given the earlier concern, so I told him to keep an eye on it and we'd deal with it later—there was no fuel consumption issue or anything on the combustion side, so it didn't feel urgent next to what I was already watching.

The real event came about ten hours before the tide window closed. We got a sudden exhaust temperature spike and a distinct knock-type vibration—clearly the bearing itself now, not just bedding in. At that point we were deep into it. We jury-rigged a fix, brought the load down, and pushed on to make berth rather than diverting.

Interviewer: Let's slow down and reconstruct that in order. What did you observe first, and how did things develop from there?

Participant: First was the mild vibration and temperature deviation, day two of the leg. Then it settled, then the system showed clean readings for a good stretch. The filter differential pressure note came in maybe a day and a half after that. Then the temperature spike and vibration event came about ten hours before we were due at the tide window. So there was a real gap—almost three days—between the first hint and the actual failure.

Interviewer: Going back to that first deviation—what information did you actually have, and what did you weigh?

Participant: I had the raw numbers, both inside the normal band, and I had the fact that this unit had just been fully overhauled. Those two things pulled in different directions a bit—on one hand you could say any deviation after a rebuild deserves a look, but on the other, we'd just paid to have that bearing and the running gear replaced, so a bearing problem three weeks later seemed like a stretch. I remember thinking it made more sense as running-in than as an actual fault. The alternative was to ease off and inspect right there, but with the tide window ahead, and given we'd just sunk real money and yard time into that unit, continuing and monitoring felt like the more reasonable read of the situation.

Interviewer: When the system showed everything back in the green band, what led you to skip the manual check?

Participant: Mainly that the system readout was clean across the board—no alarms, nothing trending badly. I had the option of pulling a sample; my second engineer wasn't tied up with anything else. But the system existed exactly to tell us this kind of thing, and it was telling me things were fine. Doing a manual check on top of a clean system readout felt like it would've just confirmed what the instruments were already saying.

Interviewer: When the fuel filter report came in, how did you decide where to put your attention?

Participant: At that moment I was watching the turbocharger closely because of the earlier reading, so that's where my head was. The filter note got acknowledged—I told him we'd track it—but I didn't stop what I was doing to dig into it. There was no fuel or combustion symptom tied to it, so it didn't compete strongly for attention against what I already considered the open item.

Interviewer: When the bearing failed with the tide window ten hours out, what options did you consider, and what tipped it?

Participant: Two real options: reduce right down and divert to the nearest port for a proper repair, which would've cost us the tide window and probably several days, or jury-rig something at reduced load and make our original berth. We only had a partial bearing kit onboard, not a full replacement. What tipped it, honestly, was that we'd already put so much into this unit—the overhaul cost, the time we'd already spent watching and troubleshooting it—and diverting felt like it would waste all of that on top of the schedule hit. So we went with the jury rig.

Interviewer: How much did time pressure factor in across these moments, and how confident were you at each stage?

Participant: The tide window was in the back of my mind at every one of these points, more so as we got closer to it. Early on I was fairly confident it was running-in. By the green-band reading I was quite confident there was nothing there. By the fuel filter note I wasn't worried at all—it seemed unrelated. By the failure itself, confidence obviously dropped, but by then options were also narrower.

Interviewer: What would have changed your decision at any of these points—what information was missing?

Participant: If the system had actually thrown an alarm at that first deviation, or if a manual sample early on had shown metal particulates, I'd have acted immediately. The instruments just never gave me that trigger until the spike itself.

Interviewer: Looking back now, how would you characterize that very first vibration reading?

Participant: Honestly, looking at it now, it was probably the bearing telling us something from the start—it seems fairly clear in hindsight that that was the early stage of the same failure, not bedding in at all.

Interviewer: If the overhaul hadn't just happened, do you think you'd have reacted differently to that first signal?

Participant: Probably, yes. Without the overhaul fresh in mind, an elevated reading like that might've gotten a closer look sooner rather than being read as settling-in.

Interviewer: And if there'd been no tide window at all—would the decision at the failure point have gone differently?

Participant: It's possible. Without that deadline pulling at me, diverting might have felt like a cleaner, more straightforward call rather than one that came with a schedule cost attached.

Interviewer: Last one—what would you tell a junior engineer to watch for differently, based on this?

Participant: I'd say don't let a recent repair make you assume a component's off the table for new problems, and don't let one system you're watching closely crowd out something else being reported to you, even if it seems minor at the time.}}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
