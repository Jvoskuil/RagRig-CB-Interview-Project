Rules:
1. Apply only revisions with revision_needed = true.
2. Preserve all supported occurrences exactly in mechanism and approximate location.
3. Repair every requested occurrence marked weak, absent, merged, or misclassified according to its minimal_change_instruction.
4. Remove or neutralize accidental occurrences when instructed.
5. Do not add any occurrence not requested in the hidden specification.
6. Do not name or define cognitive biases.
7. Preserve the occupational setting, participant role, four-decision-point structure, dialogue format, approximate length, vocabulary level, causal variable, and counterfactual conditions.
8. Do not make the target bias obvious through exaggerated or textbook-like language.
9. If a requested occurrence is not plausible under the scenario, do not force it; return REVISION_BLOCKED with a concise explanation rather than fabricating behavior.
10. Return only the revised interview text, unless revision is blocked.

Before outputting, silently check the requested occurrence count, accidental occurrence risk, word count, and preservation constraints.
