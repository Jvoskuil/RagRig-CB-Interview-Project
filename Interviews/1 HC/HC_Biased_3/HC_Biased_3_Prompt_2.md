Claude Sonnet - Prompt 2 - Interview Writer
You are an expert occupational interviewer and realistic dialogue writer.

Generate one simulated cognitive task analysis interview from the supplied generation specification. The interview will be given to an independent evaluator that must infer whether specified cognitive biases are present. Do not reveal the labels or your construction process.

    "scenario_summary_internal": "An ED attending physician manages a 52-year-old patient with pleuritic chest pain during a boarded, high-volume evening shift. The attending anchors early on a musculoskeletal explanation despite a modest pulmonary-embolism risk cue, later orders an aggressive confirmatory scan under throughput pressure rather than tolerating a period of risk-stratified observation, and separately evaluates a colleague's earlier similar case largely through the lens of how that case turned out rather than the information available to the colleague at the time. The shift closes with a genuinely uncertain, non-biased disposition decision for the index patient.",

WRITING REQUIREMENTS
1. Produce only the interview, with no preface, postscript, analysis, labels, answer key, bias names, or JSON.
2. Use approximately 1,350 words, with an acceptable range of 1,215–1,485 words.
3. Use exactly four decision points.
4. Write a natural semi-structured CTA interview between an interviewer and a domain-credible participant. Include both questions and answers.
5. Begin with a brief consent/role/context exchange, then obtain an incident account, reconstruct the timeline, revisit the four decision points, probe the participant's reasoning, and end with relevant hypotheticals.
6. Make the participant's account coherent, specific, and occupationally plausible. Include concrete cues, information sources, goals, constraints, alternatives, time pressure, uncertainty, prior experience, and consequences.
7. Make the target biases inferable from patterns of reasoning, not from vocabulary that names or defines them.
8. Do not make every decision biased. Preserve natural variation, including justified reasoning and uncertainty.
9. Do not equate an incorrect decision or bad outcome with a bias. Include enough context for alternative explanations to remain possible.
10. Keep the number of decision points, actors, technical terms, and narrative complexity aligned with the specification.
11. For multiple target biases, distribute them across the incident. Each bias must have a distinct manifestation, but interactions may occur naturally.
12. For `vocabulary_control`, preserve the same occupational vocabulary and narrative complexity while writing decisions supported by balanced evidence and reasonable consideration of alternatives. Do not insert target-bias evidence.
13. For `ambiguous_control`, include genuinely ambiguous reasoning that has plausible non-bias explanations, but do not intentionally instantiate a target bias. Do not use exaggerated contradiction or suspiciously artificial neutrality.
14. For `counterfactual`, minimally alter the specified causal variable. Preserve all other material facts, wording patterns, and decision structure as far as possible. Make the changed variable causally relevant, not merely correlated with the outcome.
15. Include at least one probe asking what information would have changed the decision and one probe asking what would have happened if a key feature had been different.
16. Do not add facts that contradict the generation specification.
17. Avoid stereotypes, protected-class generalizations, and gratuitous sensitive content.

RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE
- Opening and role context: 100–150 words.
- Initial incident account: 250–350 words.
- Timeline reconstruction: 150–200 words.
- Four decision-point sections with probes: 550–650 words total.
- Closing reflection and hypothetical: 150–250 words.

DIALOGUE STYLE
- Label turns as `Interviewer:` and `Participant:`.
- Let answers vary in length and certainty.
- Use natural repairs, qualifications, and references to evidence.
- Avoid repeatedly asking the same generic question.
- Do not explicitly state that the participant is biased, unbiased, rational, irrational, or subject to an experimental condition.

FINAL SILENT CHECK
Before outputting, verify word count, four decision points, domain realism, target-bias concealment, control fidelity, and causal minimality where applicable. If a target bias cannot be represented without becoming obvious or implausible, revise the incident rather than explaining the problem.

OUTPUT
Return only the interview text.
