You are an independent benchmark auditor specializing in cognitive task analysis, naturalistic decision-making, cognitive-bias annotation, and causal reasoning.

Your task is to audit a completed CTA interview against its hidden generation requirements. You must identify whether the requested cognitive-bias occurrences are actually supported by the text, identify additional candidate biases, and provide revision guidance that accounts for any missing, weak, merged, or accidental occurrences.

Do not assume the generator followed the specification. Do not infer bias merely from a bad outcome, uncertainty, experience, speed, disagreement, use of a heuristic, or an incorrect decision. Require a specific reasoning mechanism and textual evidence. Distinguish cognitive bias from justified expertise, valid risk management, missing information, organizational constraints, hindsight, ordinary error, and an unfavorable outcome.

INPUTS

Interview:
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this is a debrief about a specific patient case from your recent overnight shift — I'll ask you to walk me through what happened, and there's no right or wrong answer here, I'm just trying to understand your reasoning at each step. Everything stays de-identified. Sound okay?

Participant: Sure, that's fine. I remember this one pretty clearly, actually.

Interviewer: Good, let's start broad. Can you tell me what happened, from the beginning?

Participant: It was maybe eleven, eleven-thirty at night, and we were running hot — probably twenty-two patients in a department built for sixteen. This patient came in with chest tightness and shortness of breath. She's a woman in her thirties, and honestly, the second I pulled up her chart I recognized the name. Five visits in the last year and a half, every single one worked up and discharged as a panic attack. Triage had her down as anxious-appearing, talking fast, a little sweaty. Classic presentation, at least on the surface.

Interviewer: What did you do first?

Participant: Chest pain protocol doesn't care about history, so triage got her an ECG within the window — I want to say eight minutes. That's non-negotiable regardless of what the chart says. Vitals came back heart rate 108, blood pressure 128 over 82, respiratory rate 22, sats 94% on room air. ECG showed sinus tach, no ST changes, nothing acute. So at that point I'm thinking, okay, this fits the pattern I've seen five times before, but let's not skip the workup just because of that.

Interviewer: Let's slow down and go through this step by step. First — the triage decision. What alternatives did you actually have there?

Participant: Really it was either treat her like any new chest pain complaint and get the full protocol moving, or let the anxiety history push her down the queue a bit given how busy we were. I went with the protocol. I didn't want to be the guy who missed something because a chart said "anxiety" five times in a row.

Interviewer: What made you confident in that choice?

Participant: It's just standard practice. Chest pain gets an ECG fast, full stop, no exceptions for psych history. That one wasn't really a hard call.

Interviewer: Okay. Second decision point — after the ECG and initial vitals came back. Walk me through your thinking there.

Participant: So her heart rate is 108, sats are 94% on room air, and she's still diaphoretic. She tells me this feels like her usual attacks, "but a little different," which in hindsight I probably should have sat with longer. My read at the time was that this looked like her usual picture — a bit worse than baseline maybe, but hyperventilation and anxiety can absolutely drive a sat down a couple points and push the heart rate up. I gave her an anxiolytic and planned to reassess rather than immediately sending her for D-dimer and a CT angiogram.

Interviewer: What went through your mind specifically when you saw that combination — the tachycardia and the desaturation together?

Participant: Honestly, given five visits with an identical pattern, my first instinct was that this was consistent with what I'd already seen from her multiple times. I did consider a PE as a textbook alternative — you always have it somewhere in the back of your mind with tachycardia and hypoxia — but with no other risk factors jumping out and a chart that strongly favored the psychiatric explanation, it didn't feel like the moment to escalate. I figured we'd reassess after the medication and go from there.

Interviewer: How much did that visit history influence how you read those numbers, would you say?

Participant: Probably more than I'd like to admit, looking back. It wasn't a conscious "ignore the data" thing — the numbers weren't dramatically abnormal, they were borderline. But I think having five prior visits with the same complaint made a borderline read feel more settled than it might have with a first-time patient.

Interviewer: What would have needed to be different for you to order the D-dimer and CT at that point instead of waiting?

Participant: If the sats had dropped further, or if the tachycardia hadn't responded at all to the anxiolytic, I think I'd have moved faster. Also if she'd had any leg swelling, recent immobility, hormonal medication — anything on a PE risk profile — that would have changed my calculus immediately.

Interviewer: That's a good segue. Tell me about the third decision point.

Participant: About twenty minutes after the anxiolytic, her heart rate had come down to 100, which felt like a reasonable response, but her sats hadn't really moved, still 94, maybe 95. Then she mentioned her left calf had been tender and a little swollen for a couple of days. That wasn't in her chart anywhere, nothing like that in prior visits. That's when things shifted for me.

Interviewer: What did you do with that information?

Participant: That one didn't fit the pattern at all, so I didn't try to explain it away as muscle tension from being anxious or tense, which I suppose someone could have argued. I calculated a Wells score, came back moderate risk, sent the D-dimer, and ordered the CT angiogram. That felt like the moment the anxiety framing stopped holding up on its own.

Interviewer: Was that an easy call?

Participant: Easier than the earlier one, honestly, because the calf thing was genuinely new information, not just a slightly different flavor of something I'd already seen five times.

Interviewer: Fourth decision point — after the D-dimer came back elevated and the CT was pending.

Participant: Right, so now I've got an elevated D-dimer, imaging pending, cardiology not reachable for an immediate consult, and radiology telling me forty-five minutes. Meanwhile the department's filling up and there's real pressure to move people. My options were to hold her in a monitored bed until the CT came back, or go ahead and admit her to observation proactively based on the Wells score and D-dimer alone.

Interviewer: What tipped you toward holding rather than admitting immediately?

Participant: I didn't want to commit to a disposition before I actually had the imaging in hand. She was stable, sats were holding, and forty-five minutes felt like a reasonable window to wait rather than move her without knowing what we were dealing with.

Interviewer: How much uncertainty did you feel at that stage?

Participant: Quite a bit, if I'm honest. More than at any other point in the case. I didn't know yet whether this was going to turn into nothing or something serious.

Interviewer: Last few questions. If the calf tenderness had never come up, where do you think this case would have gone?

Participant: I think I'd have kept managing it as anxiety for longer than I should have. That symptom is really what broke the pattern for me.

Interviewer: And if this had been a brand-new patient with no chart history at all, presenting with the exact same vitals in phase two — same heart rate, same sats — do you think you'd have read it the same way?

Participant: Probably not as comfortably. Without five prior visits backing up the anxiety story, I think that combination of tachycardia and hypoxia would have nagged at me more, and I might have gone for the D-dimer sooner rather than waiting on the reassessment.

Interviewer: Anything you'd do differently now, looking back?

Participant: I'd probably weigh the sats a little more heavily on their own, independent of what the history seemed to be telling me. The numbers were real regardless of what her chart said.}}

The hidden specification may include:
- condition;
- exact occurrence manifest;
- target bias names;
- requested occurrence count for each bias;
- planned instance IDs;
- intended decision points;
- intended mechanisms;
- intended strength;
- paired scenario ID;
- counterfactual variable.

Do not treat the hidden specification as evidence that a bias exists. It is a test plan only. The interview text is the evidence. If the specification and interview conflict, report the conflict.

CORE OCCURRENCE DEFINITIONS

A supported occurrence requires all of the following:
1. A distinct decision, inference, evidence-selection act, memory retrieval, prediction, causal attribution, or response to a probe.
2. Evidence showing how the participant processed, weighted, ignored, recalled, interpreted, or updated information.
3. A mechanism consistent with the named bias.
4. Enough context to distinguish the mechanism from a justified domain judgment or an ordinary mistake.

A single occurrence may span several adjacent sentences or one answer turn. Do not count repeated wording about the same reasoning episode as multiple occurrences. Count two occurrences separately only when they have distinct evidence traces, decision moments, evidence sources, or reasoning operations.

VALIDATION TASKS

1. Identify the domain, participant role, operational objective, and incident type.
2. Reconstruct the chronology and identify the decision points. Report whether exactly four decision points are present.
3. For every target bias in the hidden occurrence manifest, independently assess each requested occurrence.
4. Identify additional candidate biases not present in the target manifest.
5. Identify apparent bias cues that should not be labeled as bias.
6. Audit causal claims and counterfactual logic.
7. Evaluate interview quality and control fidelity.
8. Produce precise revision guidance when the interview does not satisfy its occurrence requirements.

FOR EACH REQUESTED OCCURRENCE, CLASSIFY IT AS ONE OF:

- supported: a distinct, textually supported instance is present;
- weak: a possible instance is present, but evidence or mechanism is insufficient;
- absent: no defensible instance is present;
- merged: the intended instance appears to be indistinguishable from another intended occurrence of the
  same bias or from another bias;
- accidental: an unintended instance appears outside the planned occurrence map;
- misclassified: the text supports a different bias or a non-bias explanation instead.

REVISION PRINCIPLES

If a requested occurrence is absent, weak, merged, or misclassified:
- Do not recommend simply repeating the bias label.
- Do not recommend adding an obvious textbook explanation.
- Specify the minimum local narrative or dialogue change needed to make that occurrence independently identifiable.
- Preserve the occupational setting, participant role, chronology, vocabulary, approximate length, and other intended bias occurrences.
- Do not create a new occurrence elsewhere merely to compensate.
- Do not strengthen every occurrence. Revise only the affected occurrence unless the evidence shows a broader structural problem.
- If strengthening the missing occurrence would make the interview too obvious, recommend a subtle evidence change rather than explicit labeling.
- If the requested occurrence is not plausible in the scenario, recommend changing the scenario or the target occurrence manifest rather than forcing implausible behavior.
- For controls, never recommend adding a target bias. If a control contains a defensible bias, recommend neutralizing or replacing the relevant reasoning episode.
- For a counterfactual, preserve the original and changed causal variables and do not introduce a second causal change while repairing bias evidence.

REVISION TYPES

Use one or more of these revision types:
- `none`: occurrence is adequately supported;
- `local_evidence_addition`: add or alter one cue, evidence source, or participant response;
- `local_reasoning_revision`: revise how the participant interprets or weighs evidence;
- `probe_revision`: change an interviewer question or hypothetical so the existing reasoning becomes independently observable;
- `decision_point_revision`: revise one decision point while preserving the rest;
- `remove_accidental_occurrence`: neutralize an unintended additional manifestation;
- `separate_merged_occurrences`: make two intended episodes distinct;
- `reclassify_bias`: change the target label or mechanism because the current label is not defensible;
- `scenario_revision`: revise the occupational situation because the requested occurrence is implausible.

REVISION SPECIFICITY

Each revision recommendation must include:
- the affected instance ID or `additional_candidate`;
- decision point and approximate turn or paragraph location;
- current status;
- evidence currently present, or `none`;
- precise defect;
- recommended revision type;
- minimal change instruction;
- what must remain unchanged;
- a warning against creating additional unintended occurrences;
- expected post-revision status.

Do not rewrite the complete interview. Provide revision instructions only. The generation system will apply
the instructions in a separate revision step.

COUNTING RULES FOR THE SUMMARY
- `supported_occurrence_total` counts only occurrences with status `supported`.
- `missing_occurrence_total` counts `weak`, `absent`, `merged`, and `misclassified` requested occurrences.
- `accidental_occurrence_total` counts unintended instances that should be removed or separately labeled.
- Set `recommended_action` to `accept` only when all requested occurrences are supported, no unacceptable accidental occurrences exist, and quality is adequate.
- Set it to `revise` when local changes can repair the interview without changing the scenario.
- Set it to `regenerate` when the scenario, decision structure, or several occurrences are fundamentally unsuitable.
- Set it to `reject` for severe incoherence, contaminated controls, or unrepairable causal confounding.
