INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this is a debrief about a specific patient case from your recent overnight shift — I'll ask you to walk me through what happened, and there's no right or wrong answer here, I'm just trying to understand your reasoning at each step. Everything stays de-identified. Sound okay?

Participant: Sure, that's fine. I remember this one pretty clearly, actually.

Interviewer: Good, let's start broad. Can you tell me what happened, from the beginning?

Participant: It was maybe eleven, eleven-thirty at night, and we were running hot — probably twenty-two patients in a department built for sixteen. This patient came in with chest tightness and shortness of breath. She's a woman in her thirties, and honestly, the second I pulled up her chart I recognized the name. Five visits in the last year and a half, every single one worked up and discharged as a panic attack. Triage had her down as anxious-appearing, talking fast, a little sweaty. Classic presentation, at least on the surface.

Interviewer: What did you do first?

Participant: Chest pain protocol doesn't care about history, so triage got her an ECG within the window — I want to say eight minutes. That's non-negotiable regardless of what the chart says. Vitals came back heart rate 108, blood pressure 128 over 82, respiratory rate 22, sats 94% on room air. ECG showed sinus tach, no ST changes, nothing acute. So at that point I'm thinking, okay, this fits the pattern I've seen five times before, but let's not skip the workup just because of that.

Interviewer: Let's slow down and go through this step by step. First — the triage decision. What alternatives did you actually have there?

Participant: Really it was either treat her like any new chest pain complaint and get the full protocol moving, or let the anxiety history push her down the queue a bit given how busy we were. I went with the protocol. I didn't want to be the guy who missed something because a chart said "anxiety" five times in a row.

Interviewer: What made you confident in that choice?

Participant: It's just standard practice. Chest pain gets an ECG fast, full stop, no exceptions for psych history. That one wasn't really a hard call.

Interviewer: Okay. Second decision point — after the ECG and initial vitals came back. Walk me through your thinking there.

Participant: So her heart rate is 108, sats are 94% on room air, and she's still diaphoretic. She tells me this feels like her usual attacks, "but a little different," which in hindsight I probably should have sat with longer. My read at the time was that this looked like her usual picture — a bit worse than baseline maybe, but hyperventilation and anxiety can absolutely drive a sat down a couple points and push the heart rate up. I gave her an anxiolytic and planned to reassess rather than immediately sending her for D-dimer and a CT angiogram.

Interviewer: What went through your mind specifically when you saw that combination — the tachycardia and the desaturation together?

Participant: Honestly, given five visits with an identical pattern, my first instinct was that this was consistent with what I'd already seen from her multiple times. I did consider a PE as a textbook alternative — you always have it somewhere in the back of your mind with tachycardia and hypoxia — but with no other risk factors jumping out and a chart that strongly favored the psychiatric explanation, it didn't feel like the moment to escalate. I figured we'd reassess after the medication and go from there.

Interviewer: How much did that visit history influence how you read those numbers, would you say?

Participant: Probably more than I'd like to admit, looking back. It wasn't a conscious "ignore the data" thing — the numbers weren't dramatically abnormal, they were borderline. But I think having five prior visits with the same complaint made a borderline read feel more settled than it might have with a first-time patient.

Interviewer: What would have needed to be different for you to order the D-dimer and CT at that point instead of waiting?

Participant: If the sats had dropped further, or if the tachycardia hadn't responded at all to the anxiolytic, I think I'd have moved faster. Also if she'd had any leg swelling, recent immobility, hormonal medication — anything on a PE risk profile — that would have changed my calculus immediately.

Interviewer: That's a good segue. Tell me about the third decision point.

Participant: About twenty minutes after the anxiolytic, her heart rate had come down to 100, which felt like a reasonable response, but her sats hadn't really moved, still 94, maybe 95. Then she mentioned her left calf had been tender and a little swollen for a couple of days. That wasn't in her chart anywhere, nothing like that in prior visits. That's when things shifted for me.

Interviewer: What did you do with that information?

Participant: That one didn't fit the pattern at all, so I didn't try to explain it away as muscle tension from being anxious or tense, which I suppose someone could have argued. I calculated a Wells score, came back moderate risk, sent the D-dimer, and ordered the CT angiogram. That felt like the moment the anxiety framing stopped holding up on its own.

Interviewer: Was that an easy call?

Participant: Easier than the earlier one, honestly, because the calf thing was genuinely new information, not just a slightly different flavor of something I'd already seen five times.

Interviewer: Fourth decision point — after the D-dimer came back elevated and the CT was pending.

Participant: Right, so now I've got an elevated D-dimer, imaging pending, cardiology not reachable for an immediate consult, and radiology telling me forty-five minutes. Meanwhile the department's filling up and there's real pressure to move people. My options were to hold her in a monitored bed until the CT came back, or go ahead and admit her to observation proactively based on the Wells score and D-dimer alone.

Interviewer: What tipped you toward holding rather than admitting immediately?

Participant: I didn't want to commit to a disposition before I actually had the imaging in hand. She was stable, sats were holding, and forty-five minutes felt like a reasonable window to wait rather than move her without knowing what we were dealing with.

Interviewer: How much uncertainty did you feel at that stage?

Participant: Quite a bit, if I'm honest. More than at any other point in the case. I didn't know yet whether this was going to turn into nothing or something serious.

Interviewer: Last few questions. If the calf tenderness had never come up, where do you think this case would have gone?

Participant: I think I'd have kept managing it as anxiety for longer than I should have. That symptom is really what broke the pattern for me.

Interviewer: And if this had been a brand-new patient with no chart history at all, presenting with the exact same vitals in phase two — same heart rate, same sats — do you think you'd have read it the same way?

Participant: Probably not as comfortably. Without five prior visits backing up the anxiety story, I think that combination of tachycardia and hypoxia would have nagged at me more, and I might have gone for the D-dimer sooner rather than waiting on the reassessment.

Interviewer: Anything you'd do differently now, looking back?

Participant: I'd probably weigh the sats a little more heavily on their own, independent of what the history seemed to be telling me. The numbers were real regardless of what her chart said.}}

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:

  "interview_id": "{{HC_Biased_1}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Healthcare}}",
  "role": "{{Emergency Department Attending Physician}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
