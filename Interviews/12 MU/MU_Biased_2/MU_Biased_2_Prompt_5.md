INTERVIEW
{{**Interviewer:** Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this is a voluntary debrief for our internal learning review, not a disciplinary process — anything you share helps us understand decision-making under uncertainty, not to assign blame. Can you start by telling me your role and what you were responsible for during this incident?

**Participant:** Sure. I'm the ground control specialist for the site — geotech engineer by training. I cover support design, monitoring interpretation, and sign-off on ground conditions for active headings. During this shift I was working from the surface office but on call for anything flagged at the 4200 development face and the adjacent bolted heading next to it.

**Interviewer:** Good. Before we get into specifics, can you give me a general account of what happened, start to finish?

**Participant:** It started with a call from the shift boss — minor rib spalling near the 4200 face, right after a blast, with a bit of dust puffing off the wall. Nobody was hurt, the crew actually paused on their own, which I give them credit for. Our extensometer near that face had been down for about two days — the bolting rig had knocked the cable loose — so I didn't have fresh convergence numbers for that specific spot. I authorized them to keep mucking with a visual check, because honestly this looked a lot like something we'd seen at the 3800 panel about six months back, where the cause turned out to be the operator undercutting too aggressively on the bottom of the round.

A bit later the scaling crew called in with bigger slabs than first described, plus a hairline fracture pattern we hadn't logged before. We're roughly fifteen to twenty meters from a mapped fault splay there, though the exact position is fuzzy — exploration drilling only gives you so much. I ran our convergence model using the nearest working stations, which weren't right at the face, and it came back with a low displacement forecast. That gave me enough to let the round finish.

After the round, spalling showed up in the adjacent bolted heading too. The shift boss asked if we should mesh and bolt before the next rotation, and the mine manager reminded me that would blow our weekly advance number. I held off. A couple hours later a crack opened along a bolt row in that heading. Technician wanted an immediate evacuation. I let a short monitored entry happen instead. Not long after, we had a larger fall in that section. No one was hurt — an unrelated alarm actually cleared people out just before it happened — but it could have gone differently.

**Interviewer:** Let's reconstruct the timeline a bit more precisely. What exactly did you know at the moment of that first call?

**Participant:** Just the spalling, the dust, no injuries, crew stopped on their own initiative. And that our monitoring near that face was blind because of the extensometer outage.

**Interviewer:** And after the scaling crew's second report?

**Participant:** That's when the picture got more complicated — bigger slabs, a fracture pattern, and the fault splay proximity became more relevant in my head.

**Interviewer:** When did you first pull up the convergence model output, and what did you do with it?

**Participant:** Right after that second report. I wanted something more than visual judgment before letting the round finish.

**Interviewer:** Walk me through the gap between finishing the round and the evacuation call.

**Participant:** Round finished, spalling in the adjacent heading came up, I deferred the support order, then the crack appeared maybe two hours later, and the technician pushed for evacuation almost immediately after that.

**Interviewer:** Let's go through the first decision — authorizing continued mucking. What alternatives did you weigh?

**Participant:** I could've stopped everything for a full inspection, or restricted a buffer zone and resequenced the round. I chose the visual-check option.

**Interviewer:** What made the 3800 comparison feel relevant enough to lean on here?

**Participant:** The symptoms looked similar — spalling right after a blast cycle. At 3800 we'd traced that to the operator undercutting on the bottom of the round, and once that case was in my head, my first read here was that we were probably looking at something similar — a shallow, crew-induced spall out of the cut or cleanup sequence, not necessarily anything structural. I didn't actually have anything from this round confirming that; it was more that the 3800 case gave me a ready-made explanation to reach for.

**Interviewer:** Did the missing extensometer data factor into that judgment?

**Participant:** Honestly, less than it should have. Once I'd settled on the crew-sequence explanation, the monitoring gap felt like a secondary concern rather than something that should have pushed me toward taking the geological angle more seriously.

**Interviewer:** Second decision — using the convergence model output to justify finishing the round. How did you decide it applied here?

**Participant:** That model's been solid for us — it called ground behavior accurately on a panel we ran last year. So when it came back low-displacement, I trusted that read.

**Interviewer:** The technician mentioned a calibration concern. Can you describe that?

**Participant:** She said the model was built on data from a different rock mass domain and might not transfer well this close to the fault splay. I heard her, but between the track record and the schedule pressure, I went with the output as it stood.

**Interviewer:** Third decision — deferring the supplemental support order. What was the basis?

**Participant:** The model's forecast was still sitting there as stable, so nothing had come in that reset the picture I already had. I treated it as the same authorization carrying forward from the face decision, rather than reopening the question, and the manager had flagged the schedule impact on top of that. I was planning to revisit support once we had updated readings from that heading.

**Interviewer:** What would have changed that decision?

**Participant:** Fresh convergence readings right at that heading, honestly. Or if the crack had shown up before I made the call instead of after.

**Interviewer:** Fourth decision — allowing the brief entry after the crack appeared. What was your reasoning?

**Participant:** I didn't have a fresh geotechnical read on the crack itself — nobody had run a new assessment specific to it — so I was essentially still operating inside the decision I'd made earlier in the shift. Given the timeline we were on, I opted for a short, monitored entry instead of a full lockout, treating it as a controlled check on an open question rather than something I'd already settled one way or the other.

**Interviewer:** How much did time pressure factor into that specific call?

**Participant:** A fair amount. The next crew was due within the hour, and stopping everything again would have meant a second schedule hit in one shift.

**Interviewer:** Looking back, if the extensometer had been working the entire time, do you think your decisions would have gone differently?

**Participant:** Probably, at least at the first and third points. Real numbers instead of an analogy might have shifted things earlier.

**Interviewer:** And if the 3800 investigation had reached a different conclusion at the time — say it had been traced to unanticipated stress redistribution near a geological structure instead of the operator's undercutting, with everything else about that case the same — do you think you'd have read this situation differently, given the same monitoring outage and schedule pressure you actually had?

**Participant:** Probably, yeah. If that case had taught me to expect a geological cause behind those symptoms, I think I'd have leaned harder on the fault-splay possibility from the first report, instead of defaulting to a crew-sequence explanation, even with the same blind spot on the extensometer and the same push to keep the round moving.

**Interviewer:** Last one — what would you do differently if a similar sequence came in again?

**Participant:** Push harder to get monitoring restored before trusting any model output, and probably treat a new fracture pattern as its own signal rather than folding it into a story that already made sense to me.

**Interviewer:** That's really helpful detail. Thanks for walking through it so openly.

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{MU_Biased_2}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Mining and underground industrial operations}}",
  "role": "{{Geotechnical Engineer / Ground Control Specialist}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
