INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. As we discussed, this is a debrief to understand your reasoning during the Stope 14-East incident, not an audit of the outcome. Everything you share helps us understand how decisions get made in the field. You're comfortable proceeding?

Participant: Yeah, that's fine. I've done these debriefs before after other events. Happy to walk through it.

Interviewer: Great. Can you first tell me a bit about your role and what your objective was that shift?

Participant: I'm the Health and Safety Officer for the site, dayshift. My main job that day was routine — checks, permits, and keeping an eye on the ground conditions in the active stopes, including 14-East, which was mid-cycle in a longhole stope. We were also under a bit of pressure to hit weekly tonnage, so there was always that background tension between keeping things moving and not cutting corners.

Interviewer: Walk me through what happened when you first got word of the noise.

Participant: Around 06:40 one of the miners came up on radio saying he'd heard some cracking, almost like popping, in the back of 14-East. Intermittent, not constant. No alarm had gone off on the microseismic array at that point. Normally that would make me lean toward "let's just check it," but honestly, my mind went straight to what happened at our sister operation two months earlier — that rockburst that made the trade press and had everyone in the region talking. It wasn't identical conditions, but it was the same ore body region, and that event was still very much front of mind for the whole crew. So even without an alarm, I treated that report as something that could be heading toward a similar event, more than I think the instrument data alone would have justified.

Interviewer: What alternatives did you weigh at that point?

Participant: There were really three options — full evacuation and stop work pending a geotech look, allow work to continue with tighter monitoring and a reviewed escape route, or just get the instrument tech to check readings first without restricting anyone. I went with the middle option: enhanced monitoring, limited access, no full evacuation. Partly because the instruments weren't flagging anything, but I'll admit the sister-mine incident weighed heavily on how urgent it felt to me in the moment.

Interviewer: Let's move to later that morning — the extensometer readings.

Participant: Right, so the 05:00 baseline was 0.2mm, which is our normal quiet reading. At 09:40 the tech radioed that it had moved to 0.6mm. That's three times the baseline in about three hours. I looked at it and thought, well, compared to this morning it's still a small number, still sub-millimeter, nothing dramatic. I didn't go back and check it against the rate-of-change table in the GCMP, which is actually the correct way to assess it — that plan cares about how fast it's moving, not just where it sits relative to where it started. In hindsight I was comparing it to the wrong reference.

Interviewer: What made the baseline feel like the right comparison at the time?

Participant: It's just naturally what you have in front of you — you saw it at 0.2 that morning, now it's 0.6, and 0.6 still sounds low in absolute terms. Ventilation had nothing unusual either, no gas, no temperature anomaly, so there was nothing else pulling my attention toward the rate-of-change side of things.

Interviewer: Did anything else factor into that call?

Participant: The mine manager was also asking for a production ETA, so there was some pull to land on "we're fine" rather than dig deeper into the trend math right then.

Interviewer: Let's talk about the conversation with your shift supervisor.

Participant: That was maybe an hour later. He's got twenty-two years underground, most of it at this site. He mentioned he'd heard similar popping back in 2009, and it hadn't come to anything. He was pretty confident it was "nothing." Around that same time the microseismic count for the shift had actually climbed to six events an hour, which is right at — actually just over — the flag threshold in our plan. I didn't push hard on whether the 2009 case actually matched today's rock type, blast pattern, or depth. His track record is strong, so his read carried a lot of weight for me in that moment, maybe more than it should have on its own.

Interviewer: You also looked at a crack in the same panel. Can you describe that?

Participant: Yes — there was a hairline crack, about a millimeter wide, that had been photographed and logged the week before as insignificant. When I looked at today's crack, I compared it side-by-side with that old photo, and it looked about the same width to me, so I read it as "consistent with what we already know is fine." What I didn't do at that point was connect it back to the microseismic number that had just ticked over the threshold — I was judging the crack against the old photo rather than against the newer seismic data.

Interviewer: What alternatives did you consider before allowing continued access?

Participant: Follow the seismic threshold strictly and pull back until the engineer signed off, split the difference and reduce crew size, or trust the supervisor's read and keep going with limited crew. I went with limited access, mostly on the supervisor's confidence and my own read of that crack photo.

Interviewer: What happened next?

Participant: The engineer eventually called back wanting the full event log, and around then someone noticed a second, wider crack near the first one. Then at 13:15 we had a minor spall — no injuries, some equipment damage. Shift change had happened about ninety minutes before that.

Interviewer: When you wrote up the incident report, how did you decide what caused it?

Participant: Looking at everything together — the overnight temperature drop, the shift change happening not long before, and the blasting in the panel next door the prior week — it came together into a pretty clean story: cooling stresses plus the handover timing plus the residual vibration from that blast. It read as a coherent explanation, so that's what I put forward as the primary account, even though the engineer's later note said several factors were plausible and none could really be confirmed as the dominant cause.

Interviewer: And on responsibility — how did you frame that?

Participant: I focused mainly on the miner who first heard the sounds and didn't escalate again after the initial 06:40 report — I felt if he'd flagged it again once the popping continued, we might have caught it sooner. I did note the missing engineer sign-off after the six-events flag, but that came across more as a process footnote than as a central cause in the report.

Interviewer: If the sister-mine rockburst had never happened, do you think your first call would have gone differently?

Participant: Possibly. I think without that fresh in everyone's mind, I might have waited for the instrument tech's check before doing anything, rather than jumping to enhanced monitoring right away.

Interviewer: If the rate-of-change threshold had displayed automatically next to the raw reading, would the second decision have changed?

Participant: Probably, yeah. If it had flagged red rather than just showing a number, I don't think I'd have leaned on the morning comparison the way I did.

Interviewer: What would you tell a newer HSO to watch for in a similar shift?

Participant: To always check the plan's actual thresholds rather than trusting a gut comparison to whatever reading you saw earlier, and to weigh a senior person's read alongside the data, not instead of it.

Interviewer: Last one — how confident are you now that the causes you listed in the report are the real ones?

Participant: Honestly, less than I was when I wrote it. It felt tidy at the time, but there were a few threads I didn't fully chase down.

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{MU_Biased_6}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Mining and underground industrial operations}}",
  "role": "{{Mine Safety/Health & Safety Officer}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
