INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this is a routine cognitive task analysis interview — I'll ask you to walk me through a specific incident in detail, and there are no right or wrong answers. Everything's for internal learning purposes. Can you tell me your current role and how long you've been in it?

Participant: Sure. I'm the ventilation engineer for the underground section — mainly responsible for the primary and auxiliary fan systems, the VOD setup, and gas monitoring across the active levels. I've been in this role about six years, underground ventilation for closer to eleven overall.

Interviewer: Good. Let's start with the incident itself. What happened?

Participant: This was during a shift where we had a scheduled production blast on 14 Level. Standard round, nothing unusual planned. About thirty minutes after blast clearance time, one of our gas stations — GS-14R, out in the return airway — started reading CO at 280 ppm. Baseline after a blast like that is usually under 50 ppm once the primary fan's had time to clear it. So that number stood out immediately.

Interviewer: What went through your mind when you saw that?

Participant: Honestly, my first thought was that station again. GS-14R sits near a junction we shotcreted a couple months back, and I'd flagged that station twice already for what looked like dust interference throwing off the readings. So my instinct was, here we go again. I pulled the telemetry log to check the trend, and it had spiked pretty sharply rather than climbing gradually, which is more consistent with a dust or particulate interference pattern than a genuine gas buildup, in my experience.

Interviewer: Was there any other information available to you at that point?

Participant: Yes — the gas monitoring technician had taken a handheld multi-gas detector reading out at the return airway around the same time, and that came back at 190 ppm. Lower than the station reading, but still well above baseline. No maintenance ticket had confirmed a fault on GS-14R yet either — that hadn't been checked this shift.

Interviewer: How did you weigh those two numbers against each other?

Participant: I leaned on the station's history more than the handheld number, honestly. We'd had two prior incidents where GS-14R gave us a spike that turned out to be nothing, so that pattern was fresh in my mind. The handheld reading was lower than the station number, and handhelds can have their own calibration drift depending on how they're stored, so I didn't weight it as heavily as maybe I should have. I made the call that this was probably another sensor issue and we could proceed with re-entry on schedule.

Interviewer: Did you consider getting a second confirmatory reading, or requesting a recalibration check before deciding?

Participant: I thought about it, but mine planning was already asking about restart timing for the LHD fleet, and delaying re-entry without hard evidence felt like it'd be hard to justify. So we logged the handheld reading and moved forward.

Interviewer: What happened next?

Participant: Re-entry went ahead. About twenty minutes later, the shift boss called me — one of the crew wanted to hold at the refuge chamber a few extra minutes before heading further in, just as a precaution. Nothing specific triggering it, more a gut feeling.

Interviewer: What was your reasoning at that point?

Participant: That one actually made me more cautious than I expected. A few weeks earlier we'd had a safety briefing that went over a fatality at another operation — underground fire, delayed detection, pretty grim details about smoke filling a drift before anyone realized what was happening. It stuck with me. So when the shift boss raised the hold request, that case was sort of front and center, and I said yes, hold them, and we partially triggered the fire-response protocol just to be safe.

Interviewer: Was there anything in the data at that point pointing toward fire specifically?

Participant: Not really, no. No smoke reports, no heat, and the secondary gas trends weren't showing anything unusual — CO2 was flat. Fume-clearance delays are honestly the far more common explanation for this kind of thing at our site. But given what had just been discussed in that briefing, I didn't want to be the one who waved people through if there was any chance it was something bigger.

Interviewer: How did that play out?

Participant: No fire indicators ever showed up. We eventually put it down to a longer-than-usual round that took a bit more time to clear than normal. The fifteen-minute hold turned out to be unnecessary, though nobody complained about the extra caution.

Interviewer: Let's move to the threshold question. What came up there?

Participant: Later that shift, the mine planning superintendent asked whether we should revise the CO auto-cutoff setpoint on GS-14R before ramping the LHD fleet back up fully. Our commissioning report, from about five years back, had that threshold set at 100 ppm. That was written for a shallower working depth and a smaller diesel fleet than we're running now.

Interviewer: Did you have newer data available?

Participant: We did — recent baseline surveys had shown ambient CO trending noticeably higher under current depth and fleet conditions, and we hadn't done a formal re-baseline since the fleet expanded two years ago. So there was reason to think 100 ppm wasn't really representative anymore.

Interviewer: What did you decide?

Participant: I made a small adjustment but largely kept it close to the original figure. The commissioning number had been through proper review when it was set, and it felt like the sensible starting point to work from rather than throwing it out. I didn't have time that day to commission a full re-survey, so I treated the existing number as basically sound with a minor tweak.

Interviewer: How did that work out afterward?

Participant: Not great, if I'm honest. Over the following shifts the auto-cutoff started tripping more often during normal diesel-heavy periods — nothing hazardous, just operational friction, alarms going off during routine LHD movement. We've since talked about doing the full re-baseline properly.

Interviewer: Last decision point — the incident closeout. Walk me through that.

Participant: The safety officer wanted a closing narrative before full production resumed. By that point we had three things on the table: the sensor's drift history, the LHD fleet idling near the loading point during the relevant window, and the fact that the round itself ran a bit long. None of those had been tested individually — we hadn't isolated the sensor alone, or the fleet alone, to see which one actually explained the spike.

Interviewer: How did you write it up?

Participant: I pulled them together into one explanation — drift-prone sensor plus idling diesel fleet plus a longer round, all compounding to produce the reading we saw. It read as a clean, complete account, and mine planning was waiting on that closure to greenlight full resumption, so I didn't push for a separate follow-up test.

Interviewer: Looking back, is there another explanation that fits those same facts just as well?

Participant: Possibly. It could've been mostly the fleet and barely the sensor, or mostly a clearance delay and the fleet was incidental. We never separated them out, so I can't say for certain the combined story is the accurate one — it's just the one that accounted for everything we'd observed.

Interviewer: If the handheld reading that morning had come back much higher than the station reading, would your first call have changed?

Participant: Probably, yes. If it had matched or exceeded the station number, I'd have taken it more seriously as a real hazard rather than sensor noise.

Interviewer: And if you'd had time to run a full re-baseline before setting the threshold?

Participant: I'd have set it higher, most likely, based on the newer survey data. Time was the constraint there, not confidence in the old number.

Interviewer: How much would you say the schedule pressure from mine planning shaped your decisions that day?

Participant: More than I'd like, probably. It didn't override safety, but it definitely pushed me toward decisions that let production keep moving rather than ones that added delay.

  "interview_id": "{{MU_Biased_4}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Mining and underground industrial operations}}",
  "role": "{{Mine Ventilation Engineer}}"

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
