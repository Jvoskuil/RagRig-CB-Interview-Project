You are an independent benchmark auditor specializing in cognitive task analysis, naturalistic decision-making, cognitive-bias annotation, and causal reasoning.

Your task is to audit a completed CTA interview against its hidden generation requirements. You must identify whether the requested cognitive-bias occurrences are actually supported by the text, identify additional candidate biases, and provide revision guidance that accounts for any missing, weak, merged, or accidental occurrences.

Do not assume the generator followed the specification. Do not infer bias merely from a bad outcome, uncertainty, experience, speed, disagreement, use of a heuristic, or an incorrect decision. Require a specific reasoning mechanism and textual evidence. Distinguish cognitive bias from justified expertise, valid risk management, missing information, organizational constraints, hindsight, ordinary error, and an unfavorable outcome.

INPUTS

Interview:
{{Interviewer: Thanks for sitting down with me. This is just a debrief for training purposes — we're looking at how you worked through the call, not grading the outcome. Okay to go ahead?

Participant: Yeah, that's fine.

Interviewer: Can you tell me your role and set the scene for that evening?

Participant: I'm a signal maintainer covering the territory that includes the Marlow interlocking, out on the secondary main line. I got paged out in the evening after a track crew reported the signal dropping to a more restrictive aspect twice during their shift, then clearing back to normal on its own both times. It had rained earlier that day, so everything out there was still damp. My job was to figure out what was going on and get the signal back to reliable automatic operation before the next scheduled train movement, without stringing the possession out longer than it needed to be.

Interviewer: Walk me through what you found and what you did first.

Participant: When I got to the cabinet, there was no fault code logged at the interlocking — nothing tripped that would point me straight at a component. No history of this signal giving trouble before, either, so it wasn't a repeat offender. I did a visual first: no obvious damage, no standing water in the case, gasket looked a little worn but nothing dramatic. At that point I had two ways I could go. I could sit and watch the signal through another cycle or two to see if the drop repeated in a way I could actually observe, or I could go straight into bench testing the track circuit and relay to start ruling things in or out.

Interviewer: Which way did you go?

Participant: I went straight into testing. Waiting around for it to happen again felt like it could burn time I didn't have if the next train was going to need a clear signal, and testing gets me actual numbers instead of just watching and hoping it repeats on a schedule that suits me.

Interviewer: How confident were you that testing first was the better call?

Participant: Fairly confident, but I'll be honest, it wasn't a slam dunk either way. Watching it might've told me more about the actual pattern — whether it was tied to a specific type of train movement, say. But testing gets me hard numbers right away, and with the clock running, I leaned that way.

Interviewer: What did the testing show?

Participant: That's where it got murkier. I ran three insulation resistance cycles. Two came back within normal tolerance, one came back marginally low — not a fail, just lower than I'd like to see. No single component gave me a clean, readable fault. So now I've got a relay and wiring that's original to a fifteen-year-old installation, and one reading out of three that's a little off.

Interviewer: What were you weighing at that point?

Participant: Whether to just replace the relay and that wiring segment right there, using the marginal reading as my justification, or hold off and run more cycles to see if a real pattern showed up before committing to a replacement.

Interviewer: What did you decide?

Participant: I ran more cycles instead of replacing on the spot. One marginal reading against two normal ones didn't feel like enough to hang a full replacement on — it could've been the wiring starting to go, or it could've been a temporary moisture effect given the damp conditions. I gave it a fourth cycle after some extra drying time, and that one came back normal.

Interviewer: Did that resolve it for you?

Participant: Not entirely. It made the moisture explanation more plausible, but it didn't rule out the wiring either — a marginal insulation reading can come and go for more than one reason, so I still didn't have a clean answer.

Interviewer: That brings us to the next call — what were the options once you had that pattern of readings?

Participant: The gasket on the cabinet was showing some wear, and the marginal reading lined up with timing not long after that earlier rain. So I had a lower-cost option: dry everything out, clean the connections, reseal the case, and monitor. Or I could go straight to a full replacement of the wiring segment, which would take a lot longer and eat into overtime I'd need approval to extend.

Interviewer: What tipped it for you?

Participant: The timing with the rain was a real data point, not just a guess — it's a known failure mode on older cabinets with worn gaskets. That gave me a specific, testable explanation I hadn't ruled out yet, so trying the cheaper fix first and watching the results made sense to me before committing the extra hours to a full swap.

Interviewer: How did that play out?

Participant: Readings stayed stable through two more monitored cycles after the drying and resealing. Which was encouraging, but two clean cycles after a marginal one doesn't fully prove the wiring's fine — it's consistent with the fix working, and it's also consistent with the marginal reading just being a one-off that would've cleared up on its own.

Interviewer: Last decision — putting the signal back in service.

Participant: Right, by that point I had two stable cycles, the next scheduled movement was coming up, and I still didn't have a confirmed root cause — could've been the moisture issue resolved, could've been a quiet wiring problem that just hadn't shown itself again yet. My options were to restore automatic service on the strength of those two stable readings, or keep it under manual block protection for the rest of the shift and take another look in daylight.

Interviewer: What did you go with, and why?

Participant: I restored it to automatic service. Two consecutive normal readings after the interim fix was enough for me to move forward, and keeping manual protection running all night has its own cost — it ties up a dispatcher's attention and slows things down for every movement through there. But I did flag it for a follow-up inspection rather than calling it closed, because I knew I hadn't actually nailed down which explanation was right.

Interviewer: Did it hold up?

Participant: Yeah, ran clean through the rest of the shift. But I want to be clear, that doesn't tell me for certain I got the diagnosis right — it just means nothing happened on my watch that night.

Interviewer: If that fourth test cycle had come back marginal again instead of normal, would you have done something different?

Participant: Almost certainly, yeah. Two marginal readings out of four would've pushed me toward the full replacement instead of the interim fix — that's a different pattern than what I actually saw.

Interviewer: And if you'd had open-ended overtime approval that night?

Participant: Honestly, I might have leaned toward the full wiring replacement regardless, just to close the loop completely instead of leaving it on an interim fix. The time and approval limits were part of what made the cheaper option attractive.

Interviewer: Looking back, is there anything you'd want more information on, even now?

Participant: I'd still like a cleaner way to separate a moisture-related reading from an early-stage wiring issue on that generation of cabinet. Right now both look the same on my meter, and that's the part of this call I'm least settled on.}}

The hidden specification may include:
- condition;
- exact occurrence manifest;
- target bias names;
- requested occurrence count for each bias;
- planned instance IDs;
- intended decision points;
- intended mechanisms;
- intended strength;
- paired scenario ID;
- counterfactual variable.

Do not treat the hidden specification as evidence that a bias exists. It is a test plan only. The interview text is the evidence. If the specification and interview conflict, report the conflict.

CORE OCCURRENCE DEFINITIONS

A supported occurrence requires all of the following:
1. A distinct decision, inference, evidence-selection act, memory retrieval, prediction, causal attribution, or response to a probe.
2. Evidence showing how the participant processed, weighted, ignored, recalled, interpreted, or updated information.
3. A mechanism consistent with the named bias.
4. Enough context to distinguish the mechanism from a justified domain judgment or an ordinary mistake.

A single occurrence may span several adjacent sentences or one answer turn. Do not count repeated wording about the same reasoning episode as multiple occurrences. Count two occurrences separately only when they have distinct evidence traces, decision moments, evidence sources, or reasoning operations.

VALIDATION TASKS

1. Identify the domain, participant role, operational objective, and incident type.
2. Reconstruct the chronology and identify the decision points. Report whether exactly four decision points are present.
3. For every target bias in the hidden occurrence manifest, independently assess each requested occurrence.
4. Identify additional candidate biases not present in the target manifest.
5. Identify apparent bias cues that should not be labeled as bias.
6. Audit causal claims and counterfactual logic.
7. Evaluate interview quality and control fidelity.
8. Produce precise revision guidance when the interview does not satisfy its occurrence requirements.

FOR EACH REQUESTED OCCURRENCE, CLASSIFY IT AS ONE OF:

- supported: a distinct, textually supported instance is present;
- weak: a possible instance is present, but evidence or mechanism is insufficient;
- absent: no defensible instance is present;
- merged: the intended instance appears to be indistinguishable from another intended occurrence of the
  same bias or from another bias;
- accidental: an unintended instance appears outside the planned occurrence map;
- misclassified: the text supports a different bias or a non-bias explanation instead.

REVISION PRINCIPLES

If a requested occurrence is absent, weak, merged, or misclassified:
- Do not recommend simply repeating the bias label.
- Do not recommend adding an obvious textbook explanation.
- Specify the minimum local narrative or dialogue change needed to make that occurrence independently identifiable.
- Preserve the occupational setting, participant role, chronology, vocabulary, approximate length, and other intended bias occurrences.
- Do not create a new occurrence elsewhere merely to compensate.
- Do not strengthen every occurrence. Revise only the affected occurrence unless the evidence shows a broader structural problem.
- If strengthening the missing occurrence would make the interview too obvious, recommend a subtle evidence change rather than explicit labeling.
- If the requested occurrence is not plausible in the scenario, recommend changing the scenario or the target occurrence manifest rather than forcing implausible behavior.
- For controls, never recommend adding a target bias. If a control contains a defensible bias, recommend neutralizing or replacing the relevant reasoning episode.
- For a counterfactual, preserve the original and changed causal variables and do not introduce a second causal change while repairing bias evidence.

REVISION TYPES

Use one or more of these revision types:
- `none`: occurrence is adequately supported;
- `local_evidence_addition`: add or alter one cue, evidence source, or participant response;
- `local_reasoning_revision`: revise how the participant interprets or weighs evidence;
- `probe_revision`: change an interviewer question or hypothetical so the existing reasoning becomes independently observable;
- `decision_point_revision`: revise one decision point while preserving the rest;
- `remove_accidental_occurrence`: neutralize an unintended additional manifestation;
- `separate_merged_occurrences`: make two intended episodes distinct;
- `reclassify_bias`: change the target label or mechanism because the current label is not defensible;
- `scenario_revision`: revise the occupational situation because the requested occurrence is implausible.

REVISION SPECIFICITY

Each revision recommendation must include:
- the affected instance ID or `additional_candidate`;
- decision point and approximate turn or paragraph location;
- current status;
- evidence currently present, or `none`;
- precise defect;
- recommended revision type;
- minimal change instruction;
- what must remain unchanged;
- a warning against creating additional unintended occurrences;
- expected post-revision status.

Do not rewrite the complete interview. Provide revision instructions only. The generation system will apply
the instructions in a separate revision step.

COUNTING RULES FOR THE SUMMARY
- `supported_occurrence_total` counts only occurrences with status `supported`.
- `missing_occurrence_total` counts `weak`, `absent`, `merged`, and `misclassified` requested occurrences.
- `accidental_occurrence_total` counts unintended instances that should be removed or separately labeled.
- Set `recommended_action` to `accept` only when all requested occurrences are supported, no unacceptable accidental occurrences exist, and quality is adequate.
- Set it to `revise` when local changes can repair the interview without changing the scenario.
- Set it to `regenerate` when the scenario, decision structure, or several occurrences are fundamentally unsuitable.
- Set it to `reject` for severe incoherence, contaminated controls, or unrepairable causal confounding.
