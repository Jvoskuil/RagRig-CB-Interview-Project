INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for sitting down with me. This is just a debrief for training purposes — we're looking at how you worked through the call, not grading the outcome. Okay to go ahead?

Participant: Yeah, that's fine.

Interviewer: Can you tell me your role and set the scene for that evening?

Participant: I'm a signal maintainer covering the territory that includes the Marlow interlocking, out on the secondary main line. I got paged out in the evening after a track crew reported the signal dropping to a more restrictive aspect twice during their shift, then clearing back to normal on its own both times. It had rained earlier that day, so everything out there was still damp. My job was to figure out what was going on and get the signal back to reliable automatic operation before the next scheduled train movement, without stringing the possession out longer than it needed to be.

Interviewer: Walk me through what you found and what you did first.

Participant: When I got to the cabinet, there was no fault code logged at the interlocking — nothing tripped that would point me straight at a component. No history of this signal giving trouble before, either, so it wasn't a repeat offender. I did a visual first: no obvious damage, no standing water in the case, gasket looked a little worn but nothing dramatic. At that point I had two ways I could go. I could sit and watch the signal through another cycle or two to see if the drop repeated in a way I could actually observe, or I could go straight into bench testing the track circuit and relay to start ruling things in or out.

Interviewer: Which way did you go?

Participant: I went straight into testing. Waiting around for it to happen again felt like it could burn time I didn't have if the next train was going to need a clear signal, and testing gets me actual numbers instead of just watching and hoping it repeats on a schedule that suits me.

Interviewer: How confident were you that testing first was the better call?

Participant: Fairly confident, but I'll be honest, it wasn't a slam dunk either way. Watching it might've told me more about the actual pattern — whether it was tied to a specific type of train movement, say. But testing gets me hard numbers right away, and with the clock running, I leaned that way.

Interviewer: What did the testing show?

Participant: That's where it got murkier. I ran three insulation resistance cycles. Two came back within normal tolerance, one came back marginally low — not a fail, just lower than I'd like to see. No single component gave me a clean, readable fault. So now I've got a relay and wiring that's original to a fifteen-year-old installation, and one reading out of three that's a little off.

Interviewer: What were you weighing at that point?

Participant: Whether to just replace the relay and that wiring segment right there, using the marginal reading as my justification, or hold off and run more cycles to see if a real pattern showed up before committing to a replacement.

Interviewer: What did you decide?

Participant: I ran more cycles instead of replacing on the spot. One marginal reading against two normal ones didn't feel like enough to hang a full replacement on — it could've been the wiring starting to go, or it could've been a temporary moisture effect given the damp conditions. I gave it a fourth cycle after some extra drying time, and that one came back normal.

Interviewer: Did that resolve it for you?

Participant: Not entirely. It made the moisture explanation more plausible, but it didn't rule out the wiring either — a marginal insulation reading can come and go for more than one reason, so I still didn't have a clean answer.

Interviewer: That brings us to the next call — what were the options once you had that pattern of readings?

Participant: The gasket on the cabinet was showing some wear, and the marginal reading lined up with timing not long after that earlier rain. So I had a lower-cost option: dry everything out, clean the connections, reseal the case, and monitor. Or I could go straight to a full replacement of the wiring segment, which would take a lot longer and eat into overtime I'd need approval to extend.

Interviewer: What tipped it for you?

Participant: The timing with the rain was a real data point, not just a guess — it's a known failure mode on older cabinets with worn gaskets. That gave me a specific, testable explanation I hadn't ruled out yet, so trying the cheaper fix first and watching the results made sense to me before committing the extra hours to a full swap.

Interviewer: How did that play out?

Participant: Readings stayed stable through two more monitored cycles after the drying and resealing. Which was encouraging, but two clean cycles after a marginal one doesn't fully prove the wiring's fine — it's consistent with the fix working, and it's also consistent with the marginal reading just being a one-off that would've cleared up on its own.

Interviewer: Last decision — putting the signal back in service.

Participant: Right, by that point I had two stable cycles, the next scheduled movement was coming up, and I still didn't have a confirmed root cause — could've been the moisture issue resolved, could've been a quiet wiring problem that just hadn't shown itself again yet. My options were to restore automatic service on the strength of those two stable readings, or keep it under manual block protection for the rest of the shift and take another look in daylight.

Interviewer: What did you go with, and why?

Participant: I restored it to automatic service. Two consecutive normal readings after the interim fix was enough for me to move forward, and keeping manual protection running all night has its own cost — it ties up a dispatcher's attention and slows things down for every movement through there. But I did flag it for a follow-up inspection rather than calling it closed, because I knew I hadn't actually nailed down which explanation was right.

Interviewer: Did it hold up?

Participant: Yeah, ran clean through the rest of the shift. But I want to be clear, that doesn't tell me for certain I got the diagnosis right — it just means nothing happened on my watch that night.

Interviewer: If that fourth test cycle had come back marginal again instead of normal, would you have done something different?

Participant: Almost certainly, yeah. Two marginal readings out of four would've pushed me toward the full replacement instead of the interim fix — that's a different pattern than what I actually saw.

Interviewer: And if you'd had open-ended overtime approval that night?

Participant: Honestly, I might have leaned toward the full wiring replacement regardless, just to close the loop completely instead of leaving it on an interim fix. The time and approval limits were part of what made the cheaper option attractive.

Interviewer: Looking back, is there anything you'd want more information on, even now?

Participant: I'd still like a cleaner way to separate a moisture-related reading from an early-stage wiring issue on that generation of cabinet. Right now both look the same on my meter, and that's the part of this call I'm least settled on.

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{RT_Ambigious_2}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Rail Transportation}}",
  "role": "{{Signal Maintainer / Signal Technician}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
