INTERVIEW
{{**Interviewer:** Thanks for taking the time. Just to confirm — this is a cognitive task analysis interview, it's confidential, and I'll be asking you to reconstruct a specific incident in detail. There's no evaluation of your performance here, just your reasoning process. Can you start by telling me your role and roughly when this happened?

**Participant:** Sure. I'm a process safety engineer at the site — I cover the batch nitration unit among others. This was about four months ago, night shift transition. I'd just come on when the trend started.

**Interviewer:** Good. Before we get into the sequence, what was the operational objective that shift?

**Participant:** Straightforward — get the batch through its exothermic hold step cleanly and into the next unit operation without deviation, so we could hand off a clean batch at shift change. Nothing unusual planned.

**Interviewer:** Walk me through what first drew your attention to the reactor.

**Participant:** The DCS trend. Pressure was running about eight percent above the expected curve for that stage of the hold. Temperature was fine, right in band, which is usually the first thing you check because if temperature's climbing too you're thinking runaway. It wasn't. So it read more like an instrumentation quirk than a reaction problem, at least on the surface.

**Interviewer:** What did you do with that information?

**Participant:** Well, by the time I'd pulled up the trend, the shift supervisor and two operators were already standing around the panel talking about it. And honestly, that conversation shaped things a lot. Someone said "this looks like the same thing we saw in March," and someone else agreed, and by the time I'd joined in, the feeling in the room was pretty settled — everyone was more confident it was benign than any one of us probably was on our own five minutes earlier. I remember thinking, going into that conversation, I wasn't sure, but coming out of it I felt fairly sure. We'd had two prior deviations like this, both chalked up to sensor drift, no incident either time. That history was doing a lot of work in the room.

**Interviewer:** So what was the actual decision at that point — stop the batch, escalate, or continue?

**Participant:** Continue monitoring. We didn't interrupt. Looking back, the alternative was to call an emergency hold pending manual inspection, or escalate straight to the on-call plant manager. I didn't push for either. The shared read in the room was "probably the same sensor issue," and that's the frame I went with.

**Interviewer:** What happened next?

**Participant:** Pressure kept climbing, slowly, over about twenty minutes. Eventually the relief valve lifted — you could hear it, a distinct pop — and then pressure fell back and reseated. No release beyond the relief line, nobody hurt. But at that point we genuinely didn't know if the batch chemistry itself was compromised.

**Interviewer:** How did you move from "we had a relief lift" to a root cause?

**Participant:** I concluded fairly quickly it was the same sensor drift pattern we'd seen before. It matched — same unit, same kind of gradual pressure creep, no temperature excursion. A full instrument and kinetics review would've taken three to four hours, and that would blow past shift changeover, so there was real pressure to land on something workable.

**Interviewer:** Did anything about this batch differ from the two prior "drift" events?

**Participant:** Yeah, actually — this batch was running a newer catalyst lot. Neither of the earlier drift events used that lot. I knew that going in, but I didn't weight it heavily. It looked enough like the earlier pattern that I was comfortable calling it drift without waiting on the fuller review.

**Interviewer:** How confident were you in that diagnosis at the time?

**Participant:** Fairly confident, honestly. I've been on this unit a long time, I've seen this signature before. It felt like a case I recognized rather than a case I needed to dig into further.

**Interviewer:** What did you learn afterward that touched on that conclusion?

**Participant:** A partial calibration spot-check later showed the transmitter was actually within tolerance. That undercuts the drift explanation somewhat. And nobody had gone back and independently reviewed the new catalyst lot's exotherm profile. So the diagnosis I'd settled on quickly was never really closed out on the chemistry side.

**Interviewer:** Let's move to the mitigation decision. What options were in front of you?

**Participant:** The external relief-system contractor reviewed the incident and came back with a data package showing our existing relief system had a narrower margin than we'd assumed, specifically for this catalyst lot. Their recommendation was to add an automated high-pressure interlock trip before restart. It's a system with a decent track record at two comparable plants. The alternative was keeping our current manual response procedure, which has run for years here without failure.

**Interviewer:** What did you decide?

**Participant:** I recommended keeping the manual procedure for this restart. The interlock wasn't something our operators had hands-on familiarity with, and introducing something new felt like it carried its own risk profile that we hadn't lived with yet. Our manual process, whatever its limits, was a known quantity.

**Interviewer:** How did you weigh the contractor's margin data against that operational familiarity?

**Participant:** I didn't dismiss the margin data, I just — I think I gave more weight to the fact that the interlock was unproven here specifically, on our unit, with our people. The margin reduction was real on paper, but it hadn't caused an actual failure yet either. The known system winning out over the new one felt like the safer bet.

**Interviewer:** Any information afterward relevant to that call?

**Participant:** The plant manager pointed out later that adding the interlock then would've cost about one shift of downtime, versus none for keeping status quo. And no further excursions happened for the rest of the campaign, so we never really got a clean test of whether the interlock would've mattered.

**Interviewer:** Take me into the MOC meeting. Who was there and what was the disagreement?

**Participant:** Myself, the senior process safety engineer — he was on the original commissioning team for this unit, well known across the plant for a strong safety record — and the contractor. The senior engineer backed my sensor-drift read, said it matched his experience with the unit over the years. The contractor's written analysis flagged the catalyst-lot kinetics as an open gap and recommended keeping the MOC open until that was resolved. No new data had come in since the calibration check.

**Interviewer:** How did you resolve that?

**Participant:** I sided with the senior engineer's view. He's someone I've worked alongside for years, part of the original team that built this unit — that carries weight with me, knowing he's lived with this reactor longer than most people on-site. And frankly, his overall safety record here is excellent, so when he says something lines up with his experience, I tend to trust that assessment even without new numbers behind it. The contractor's point was on paper, but it felt like an outside read compared to someone who's actually run this unit for fifteen years.

**Interviewer:** What happened after the MOC closed?

**Participant:** We restarted without the kinetics review. Production since then hasn't clearly proven or disproven that call either way.

**Interviewer:** Looking back across the shift, where did time pressure weigh most heavily?

**Participant:** Definitely the root cause call and the MOC closure — both had that shift-changeover clock running, and neither had a hard deadline forcing an answer, but it felt like there was one.

**Interviewer:** If the contractor's report had arrived before the control-room discussion instead of after, do you think the outcome changes?

**Participant:** Possibly. If that margin data had been sitting on the table before everyone converged on "probably fine," it might have slowed the room down. Order mattered more than I'd like to admit.

**Interviewer:** If a less senior colleague had proposed the sensor-drift explanation in that MOC meeting, would you have accepted it as readily?

**Participant:** Probably not with the same confidence, no.

**Interviewer:** What would you do differently with a similar deviation on a new catalyst lot?

**Participant:** Flag the lot change explicitly, early, before pattern-matching to prior events — treat it as its own case rather than assuming it inherits the old explanation.

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{HE_Biased_5}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{High-risk Engineering and Fire Engineering}}",
  "role": "{{Process Safety Engineer (Chemical/Industrial Facility)}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
