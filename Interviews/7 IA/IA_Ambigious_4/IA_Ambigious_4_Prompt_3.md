You are an independent benchmark auditor specializing in cognitive task analysis, naturalistic decision-making, cognitive-bias annotation, and causal reasoning.

Your task is to audit a completed CTA interview against its hidden generation requirements. You must identify whether the requested cognitive-bias occurrences are actually supported by the text, identify additional candidate biases, and provide revision guidance that accounts for any missing, weak, merged, or accidental occurrences.

Do not assume the generator followed the specification. Do not infer bias merely from a bad outcome, uncertainty, experience, speed, disagreement, use of a heuristic, or an incorrect decision. Require a specific reasoning mechanism and textual evidence. Distinguish cognitive bias from justified expertise, valid risk management, missing information, organizational constraints, hindsight, ordinary error, and an unfavorable outcome.

INPUTS

Interview:
{{Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time. This is being recorded for internal case-review purposes only, and you can skip anything you'd rather not go into. Can you start by telling me your role and background?

Participant: Sure. I'm a financial crime intelligence analyst on the FIU team, been in this specific role about six years, mostly trade finance and sanctions typologies before that.

Interviewer: I want to walk through a specific case — the Halcyon Freight matter. Can you tell me how it came to your attention and what you were trying to achieve?

Participant: It came in as part of a batch alert — four counterparties flagged together. Halcyon Freight Partners was one of them, along with a commodities trader, a small logistics subcontractor, and a shipping agent. My objective was the usual one: figure out whether there was enough here to warrant an escalation to compliance and possibly law enforcement, and do it within the ten-day filing window.

Interviewer: What did the batch actually show you?

Participant: Halcyon had one indicator that stood out — an invoice value gap, meaning the declared value didn't match what we'd expect for the goods described. No beneficial-ownership overlap with anything I'd seen before, so it wasn't ringing any specific bells. The commodities trader had a minor documentation gap, but nothing typologically interesting. It was a fairly normal week workload-wise, nothing especially heavy.

Interviewer: Walk me through what you did once you had that picture.

Participant: I prioritized Halcyon first, since the invoice gap was the clearest indicator I had to work with, and documented a plan to get through the other three that same week. I didn't ignore them — I just sequenced based on which indicator looked most substantive on its face.

Interviewer: What made you order it that way rather than, say, splitting time evenly or going by transaction size?

Participant: Honestly, either of those would have been defensible too. I went with indicator strength because that's usually a decent proxy for where the real risk sits, but I'll admit transaction size might have surfaced something different. I made a note of the reasoning in case anyone asked.

Interviewer: Did anyone ask?

Participant: Yeah, my team lead did, later. Wanted to know why I'd sequenced it that way. I walked her through the invoice-gap rationale and she was fine with it — it wasn't the only reasonable choice, but it wasn't unreasonable either.

Interviewer: What came out of the other three once you got to them?

Participant: The shipping agent turned out to have an administrative filing delay — paperwork lag, not a risk issue at all. Nothing on the logistics subcontractor either. So the sequencing didn't really cost us anything in the end, though I can't say for certain it wouldn't have mattered in a different case.

Interviewer: Let's move to the vendor report. What happened there?

Participant: A few days in, our OSINT vendor sent a report saying Halcyon's ownership structure was "plausibly consistent" with a known layering pattern. Importantly, they flagged it as moderate confidence themselves and noted one registry link hadn't been independently verified yet.

Interviewer: How did you decide how much weight to give that?

Participant: A colleague suggested we get a second data pull to firm up that specific link before leaning on the report too heavily. I thought that was reasonable, so I treated the report as partial corroboration — enough to keep building the file, not enough to treat as settled — while the second pull was requested in parallel.

Interviewer: Was there a version of this where you'd have leaned harder on the report, or set it aside entirely?

Participant: Sure, both were on the table. If it had come in with high confidence and no caveats, I probably would have moved faster. If a colleague hadn't raised the registry-link point, I might have just taken it at face value. Setting it aside completely felt like it would slow us down without much benefit, since the report was self-aware about its own gap.

Interviewer: What did the second data pull show?

Participant: It confirmed the registry link, actually. Compliance counsel later said treating it as partial rather than definitive was the right call, though I don't think that outcome alone tells you the initial judgment was necessarily correct — it could've gone the other way too.

Interviewer: Let's talk about the correspondent bank. What was that situation?

Participant: We'd requested SWIFT records and hadn't heard back. This particular correspondent's turnaround history is all over the place — I've seen requests take anywhere from five to fourteen business days, no real pattern to it. We were six days out from the filing deadline, and the liaison had just logged it as "standard priority," no timeline attached either way.

Interviewer: What did you decide to do while you waited?

Participant: Kept building the file and wrote up a contingency note — basically, what we'd file if the records didn't show up in time. Given how mixed the history was on turnaround, I didn't feel like I had grounds to assume either a fast or slow outcome, so I planned for both.

Interviewer: What actually happened?

Participant: Partial records came back on day six. Enough to inform the file, not enough to close every gap. My team lead noted we'd at least had the contingency plan ready, which helped.

Interviewer: Last stretch — the time estimate for remaining work.

Participant: Reconciling two invoice sets, drafting the narrative, compliance sign-off. Comparable cases have run anywhere from four to eight days historically — a pretty wide band. I landed on four days, near the lower end, based on the specific tasks left and the fact that neither of my other two cases was at a critical point that week.

Interviewer: What made you lean toward the lower end rather than the middle or upper end of that range?

Participant: The task list itself looked manageable, and I didn't have anything else competing hard for my time. I did flag internally that if a reconciliation issue came up, that number could slip.

Interviewer: How did it actually play out?

Participant: Pretty close. One clarifying question came up during reconciliation that cost half a day, and sign-off took about as long as I'd have expected given the case's complexity. Nothing dramatic.

Interviewer: Looking back across all four points, what were you least sure about at the time?

Participant: Probably the correspondent bank timing — that one genuinely could have gone either way, and I don't think there was a way to know in advance. The vendor report's registry link was a close second.

Interviewer: A few hypotheticals. If the shipping agent's delay had turned out to be substantive rather than administrative, what would you have done?

Participant: I'd have reshuffled priorities immediately and probably pulled in a second analyst.

Interviewer: If the vendor's report had come in high-confidence instead of moderate?

Participant: I likely would have moved to drafting the escalation sooner rather than waiting on the second pull.

Interviewer: If you'd known the records would land on day six rather than later?

Participant: Honestly, not much would've changed — the contingency plan already assumed something like that.

Interviewer: And if a colleague had reviewed your time estimate beforehand?

Participant: They might have pushed me toward the midpoint just to be safe, but I think they'd have accepted four days as reasonable given the task list.

Interviewer: That's really helpful, thank you.}}

The hidden specification may include:
- condition;
- exact occurrence manifest;
- target bias names;
- requested occurrence count for each bias;
- planned instance IDs;
- intended decision points;
- intended mechanisms;
- intended strength;
- paired scenario ID;
- counterfactual variable.

Do not treat the hidden specification as evidence that a bias exists. It is a test plan only. The interview text is the evidence. If the specification and interview conflict, report the conflict.

CORE OCCURRENCE DEFINITIONS

A supported occurrence requires all of the following:
1. A distinct decision, inference, evidence-selection act, memory retrieval, prediction, causal attribution, or response to a probe.
2. Evidence showing how the participant processed, weighted, ignored, recalled, interpreted, or updated information.
3. A mechanism consistent with the named bias.
4. Enough context to distinguish the mechanism from a justified domain judgment or an ordinary mistake.

A single occurrence may span several adjacent sentences or one answer turn. Do not count repeated wording about the same reasoning episode as multiple occurrences. Count two occurrences separately only when they have distinct evidence traces, decision moments, evidence sources, or reasoning operations.

VALIDATION TASKS

1. Identify the domain, participant role, operational objective, and incident type.
2. Reconstruct the chronology and identify the decision points. Report whether exactly four decision points are present.
3. For every target bias in the hidden occurrence manifest, independently assess each requested occurrence.
4. Identify additional candidate biases not present in the target manifest.
5. Identify apparent bias cues that should not be labeled as bias.
6. Audit causal claims and counterfactual logic.
7. Evaluate interview quality and control fidelity.
8. Produce precise revision guidance when the interview does not satisfy its occurrence requirements.

FOR EACH REQUESTED OCCURRENCE, CLASSIFY IT AS ONE OF:

- supported: a distinct, textually supported instance is present;
- weak: a possible instance is present, but evidence or mechanism is insufficient;
- absent: no defensible instance is present;
- merged: the intended instance appears to be indistinguishable from another intended occurrence of the
  same bias or from another bias;
- accidental: an unintended instance appears outside the planned occurrence map;
- misclassified: the text supports a different bias or a non-bias explanation instead.

REVISION PRINCIPLES

If a requested occurrence is absent, weak, merged, or misclassified:
- Do not recommend simply repeating the bias label.
- Do not recommend adding an obvious textbook explanation.
- Specify the minimum local narrative or dialogue change needed to make that occurrence independently identifiable.
- Preserve the occupational setting, participant role, chronology, vocabulary, approximate length, and other intended bias occurrences.
- Do not create a new occurrence elsewhere merely to compensate.
- Do not strengthen every occurrence. Revise only the affected occurrence unless the evidence shows a broader structural problem.
- If strengthening the missing occurrence would make the interview too obvious, recommend a subtle evidence change rather than explicit labeling.
- If the requested occurrence is not plausible in the scenario, recommend changing the scenario or the target occurrence manifest rather than forcing implausible behavior.
- For controls, never recommend adding a target bias. If a control contains a defensible bias, recommend neutralizing or replacing the relevant reasoning episode.
- For a counterfactual, preserve the original and changed causal variables and do not introduce a second causal change while repairing bias evidence.

REVISION TYPES

Use one or more of these revision types:
- `none`: occurrence is adequately supported;
- `local_evidence_addition`: add or alter one cue, evidence source, or participant response;
- `local_reasoning_revision`: revise how the participant interprets or weighs evidence;
- `probe_revision`: change an interviewer question or hypothetical so the existing reasoning becomes independently observable;
- `decision_point_revision`: revise one decision point while preserving the rest;
- `remove_accidental_occurrence`: neutralize an unintended additional manifestation;
- `separate_merged_occurrences`: make two intended episodes distinct;
- `reclassify_bias`: change the target label or mechanism because the current label is not defensible;
- `scenario_revision`: revise the occupational situation because the requested occurrence is implausible.

REVISION SPECIFICITY

Each revision recommendation must include:
- the affected instance ID or `additional_candidate`;
- decision point and approximate turn or paragraph location;
- current status;
- evidence currently present, or `none`;
- precise defect;
- recommended revision type;
- minimal change instruction;
- what must remain unchanged;
- a warning against creating additional unintended occurrences;
- expected post-revision status.

Do not rewrite the complete interview. Provide revision instructions only. The generation system will apply
the instructions in a separate revision step.

COUNTING RULES FOR THE SUMMARY
- `supported_occurrence_total` counts only occurrences with status `supported`.
- `missing_occurrence_total` counts `weak`, `absent`, `merged`, and `misclassified` requested occurrences.
- `accidental_occurrence_total` counts unintended instances that should be removed or separately labeled.
- Set `recommended_action` to `accept` only when all requested occurrences are supported, no unacceptable accidental occurrences exist, and quality is adequate.
- Set it to `revise` when local changes can repair the interview without changing the scenario.
- Set it to `regenerate` when the scenario, decision structure, or several occurrences are fundamentally unsuitable.
- Set it to `reject` for severe incoherence, contaminated controls, or unrepairable causal confounding.
