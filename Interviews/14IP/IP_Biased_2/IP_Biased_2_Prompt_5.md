INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this is a routine debrief on a process event from your shift — I'll ask you to walk me through what happened and how you made a few of the calls along the way. Nothing here goes into your personnel file, it's for improving our SPC response process. Sound okay?

Participant: Sure, no problem. Happy to walk through it.

Interviewer: Great. Can you start by telling me what your role was that day and what first drew your attention to the control chart?

Participant: I'm the QA analyst covering statistical process control for the turning cell that makes the automotive shafts. I was watching the Xbar-R chart for outer diameter like normal, two subgroups an hour from the automated gauge. I noticed three subgroup means in a row creeping downward, and the most recent one landed in the warning zone — inside two sigma, not over the LCL yet. Range chart was still flat, so whatever was happening wasn't blowing up part-to-part variability, just shifting the average.

Interviewer: What was going through your mind at that point?

Participant: Honestly, at 62% through the shift's quota, my first instinct was not to panic. A single warning-zone point isn't automatically an assignable cause under the Western Electric rules — you need a pattern. But three downward-trending points is a pattern worth respecting. Nothing had been logged yet, no maintenance, no material change, so I didn't have an obvious explanation.

Interviewer: Walk me through what happened next, chronologically.

Participant: I tightened up sampling instead of pulling the trigger on a full stop. I figured if it was real, the next subgroup would confirm it, and if it was noise, extra samples would show it settling back down. Sure enough, the next subgroup crossed the LCL outright. I did a manual spot check with a hand micrometer to rule out a gauge artifact, and it matched the automated reading, so I knew it was real.

Interviewer: At that first decision point, what alternatives did you weigh, and why did you choose to increase sampling rather than halt immediately?

Participant: I could have shut it down right there, or just logged it and kept going. Stopping the line on one warning-zone point felt premature — that costs us 45 minutes of changeover time we might not need, and we're still trying to hit quota. Ignoring it felt reckless given the trend. Increasing sampling was the middle path — get more data fast without committing to downtime.

Interviewer: Once you confirmed the out-of-control signal, what did you look at to figure out the cause?

Participant: I pulled up everything I had access to in real time. The shop floor temperature log showed about a three-degree rise over the same two-hour window as the drift. The material lot traveler — which lags real time by about an hour — showed a new lot had been loaded roughly ninety minutes before the drift started. I hadn't checked the tool wear sensor yet at that point. I also mentioned to our process engineer what I was seeing, and he said temperature swings had caused drift on that machine before.

Interviewer: Given both the temperature rise and the new lot were roughly time-aligned with the drift, what made you lean toward temperature as the explanation?

Participant: The timing just lined up so cleanly — the temperature started climbing and almost immediately the dimension started walking. And the engineer's comment reinforced it, since he'd seen that pattern before on this exact machine. Pulling a hardness sample on the new lot would have meant sending it to the lab and waiting, and honestly the temperature story felt like it explained things well enough that I didn't prioritize that test at the time.

Interviewer: Did you do anything to directly check the lot hypothesis before moving forward?

Participant: Not at that point, no. I noted it in my log as a secondary possibility, but I put my attention on documenting the temperature correlation and kept monitoring under that assumption.

Interviewer: Let's move to the next stretch of the shift. What came in after that?

Participant: The tool wear sensor data finally came through. It showed cumulative cutting distance at 78% of rated tool life. That surprised me a little because I'd been thinking of that insert as basically new — we'd swapped it two days earlier, and two-day-old tools don't usually burn through life that fast. But there it was. And the drift direction, diameter trending undersize, is a classic tool wear signature on that machine.

Interviewer: How did that sensor reading change your thinking about the tool?

Participant: It definitely registered as a data point I couldn't dismiss. But my mental model going in was that this tool was recently serviced and shouldn't be a major factor yet, and that's a hard thing to fully shake in the moment. I had ninety minutes left in the shift and changeover was coming up, so stopping for a full tool change felt like a big move to make off one sensor reading, even a striking one.

Interviewer: So what did you decide to do?

Participant: I made a small in-process offset adjustment to compensate for the drift and kept running, planning to keep a close eye on the next few subgroups rather than pulling the tool right away.

Interviewer: Looking back, what alternatives did you consider there, and why didn't the offset feel like enough given what the sensor showed?

Participant: I considered halting for a tool change outright, and I considered just running it out unchanged since the tool was "recently serviced." The offset felt like a reasonable middle ground given the time pressure — I wasn't fully dismissing the wear reading, I was just not ready to treat it as the whole story yet.

Interviewer: What happened after that adjustment?

Participant: The next sample still trended toward the lower spec limit, so the offset wasn't holding. Then shift changeover happened, and the incoming night operator mentioned the tool had sounded different in the last hour — a cue I obviously didn't have access to until after the handoff.

Interviewer: Bring me to the end of the shift. What did the final data show, and what did you decide?

Participant: By the end, several parts were near or slightly under the lower spec limit. The wear sensor was up to 91%. Cpk for the last two hours had dropped from 1.42 to 1.05, which is a real capability hit. At that point I recommended an immediate tool change, a temporary update to the control chart center line, and I filed a deviation report covering the affected parts.

Interviewer: What tipped you fully toward that recommendation?

Participant: The Cpk drop was the clincher, honestly, combined with the wear number climbing another thirteen points in a short window. That's not marginal anymore, that's a tool that's clearly done. And with parts sitting near spec limits, a deviation report was required regardless of what I concluded about the cause.

Interviewer: What happened after the tool change?

Participant: It resolved it. The next shift's dimensions went right back to the historical baseline. And when the lab result on that new material lot finally came back, the hardness was within spec after all — so that wasn't a factor.

Interviewer: If the tool wear data had been available an hour earlier, do you think it would have changed your call at the offset-adjustment point?

Participant: Possibly. If I'd seen 78% that much earlier with more of the shift left, I might have leaned toward the tool change sooner rather than the offset. The compressed time at the end made a bigger intervention feel less appealing.

Interviewer: And if the lot hardness test had come back out of spec instead?

Participant: Then I'd have had two live explanations instead of one, and I probably would have had to test them against each other more directly instead of settling on temperature early.

Interviewer: Anything you'd do differently in how you weighed the temperature information against the lot information?

Participant: In hindsight, I could have pulled that lot sample earlier instead of waiting — it wouldn't have cost much time, and it would have closed off one hypothesis instead of leaving it as an unexamined footnote.

Interviewer: Last one — how much did the approaching shift changeover and time pressure shape your decisions overall?

Participant: Quite a bit, especially at the tool wear point. Knowing changeover was close made me want to avoid committing to a full stop until the evidence was overwhelming, which is part of why I went with the smaller offset first instead of pulling the tool right when the sensor data came in.

Interviewer: That's really helpful, thank you for walking through all of that in detail.}}

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{IP_Biased_2}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Industrial Production Processes}}",
  "role": "{{Quality Assurance Analyst (Statistical Process Control)}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
