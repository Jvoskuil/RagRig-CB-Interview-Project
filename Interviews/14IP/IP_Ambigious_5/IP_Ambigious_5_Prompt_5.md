INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for sitting down with me. This is a cognitive task analysis interview — I want to understand how you actually worked through a specific production problem, including what you knew at each point and why you chose what you did. There are no right answers I'm grading you against. Okay to start?

Participant: Sure, no problem. I've got a decent example — the Line 3 flash issue before our Meridian shipment a few weeks back.

Interviewer: Great, let's use that. Can you describe the overall situation and what you were trying to accomplish?

Participant: We had a 72-hour window to ship a Meridian order off Line 3 — interior clips, tight tolerances. Partway through a night shift, scrap jumped from about 1.8% to 6.4%, mostly flash, some short shots. My goal was to get us back under 2% without missing the ship date and without a full shutdown, since that needs VP sign-off and we didn't have time for that process anyway.

Interviewer: What were the first signs something was wrong?

Participant: Quality flagged the scrap numbers, and the SPC chart showed cavity pressure drifting starting mid-shift. That drift range is one of those things that's ambiguous on its own — we've seen similar magnitudes tied to humidity issues before, but also to early tooling wear. So it didn't point cleanly in one direction.

Interviewer: Did anything from past experience come to mind?

Participant: We had a similar-looking defect pattern about six months back that turned out to be humidity affecting resin drying. But we'd since put in a new dehumidifier, so I honestly wasn't sure how comparable that case even was anymore. It could easily have been a red herring.

Interviewer: So what did you do with that uncertainty?

Participant: I didn't want to bet the sequencing on either guess, so I had two techs pull humidity logs and tooling wear data at the same time — they'd take roughly the same amount of time either way, so there wasn't a good reason to prioritize one over the other.

Interviewer: What came back?

Participant: Humidity logs were normal. Tooling data showed moderate wear had built up. So the wear side turned out to be the real thread, but I couldn't have known that going in — it really could have gone either way based on what we had.

Interviewer: Let's reconstruct the next couple of days. What happened once wear was confirmed?

Participant: That's decision point two. Wear was real, but the reading was right on the line — borderline between our threshold for a simple hold-pressure adjustment and the threshold for a full insert swap. My tooling lead and one of the shift supervisors actually disagreed about which side of that line we were on.

Interviewer: How did you resolve that?

Participant: We had a press-down window open right then, shared with two other product runs, and it wouldn't come around again for five days. A second measurement might have settled the disagreement, but not fast enough to still make the window. So it came down to: closing window, ambiguous reading, and a fix that would be much harder to schedule later. I went with the insert swap.

Interviewer: Did that resolve things?

Participant: Partially. Scrap improved but didn't fully get back to baseline. Could mean the wear diagnosis was right but incomplete, or that there's a second factor we haven't isolated. I genuinely don't know which.

Interviewer: Take me to the third point — the call with the sister plant.

Participant: Right, this was day two, when my quality engineer was out sick, so I had less support than usual. I learned three of our four sister plants had adopted a cooling-time reduction protocol for similar flash problems. But two of those three run a different resin lot and slightly different cavity geometry than we do, so it wasn't a clean match.

Interviewer: What did you know about how well it would apply to your line specifically?

Participant: My engineer had partially validated it against our resin lot before going out sick, but hadn't finished testing it against our specific cavity geometry. Corporate quality said results across the network looked promising but not conclusive yet.

Interviewer: So what did you decide?

Participant: I adopted it based on the partial validation we already had. I'll be honest, it could reasonably have gone the other way — waiting for full geometry testing, or rolling out a more conservative version first. I weighed the incomplete testing against the shipment clock and made a call I can defend, but I wouldn't say it was obviously the right one.

Interviewer: What happened after?

Participant: Short-term, flash defects dropped. Then two shifts later we got a new warping issue on some parts, cause not yet clear. Might be related to the cooling change, might not.

Interviewer: Last decision point — the rollout call.

Participant: Right. By the final stretch, our most recent shift showed scrap at 1.5%, best in four days. But the broader four-day trend, counting the warping issue, was messier — more like 2.9% average with real variability. Corporate quality asked if we should roll the fix to Lines 4 and 6.

Interviewer: What made that decision hard?

Participant: Lines 4 and 6 have different tooling age profiles than Line 3, so I couldn't just assume the fix would transfer cleanly either way. Given the mixed trend and those differences, I didn't think a full rollout to both lines was justified yet, but sitting on it entirely wasn't really an option with the deadline bearing down.

Interviewer: So what did you approve?

Participant: A limited pilot on one line with extra monitoring, rather than pushing it to both. I said as much to corporate — that the data didn't support going all-in yet, but doing nothing wasn't realistic either.

Interviewer: What came of the pilot?

Participant: Initial improvement, then a new tooling alarm showed up on that line that we hadn't seen before. A fuller week-long review later suggested the underlying wear issue was only partly addressed.

Interviewer: What information would have made these calls easier?

Participant: Faster wear measurements at decision two, and full geometry validation before decision three. Those were the two spots where I felt like I was deciding on incomplete information out of necessity, not preference.

Interviewer: If the last shift's numbers had come in worse instead of better, would decision four have gone differently?

Participant: Possibly less generous — maybe I'd have held off on even the pilot. But given how mixed the broader trend already was, I think I was already treating that last shift as one data point, not the whole answer.

Interviewer: Anything you'd do differently if this happened again?

Participant: Build in a standing arrangement for a second wear reading that doesn't cost us the press-down window, and push corporate for full geometry validation timelines before protocols spread across plants. Otherwise, honestly, most of these calls I'd probably make the same way again given the same constraints.

Interviewer: This has been really helpful, thank you.

Participant: Anytime.

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{IP_Ambigious_5}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Industrial Production Processes}}",
  "role": "{{Plant/Industrial Production Manager}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
