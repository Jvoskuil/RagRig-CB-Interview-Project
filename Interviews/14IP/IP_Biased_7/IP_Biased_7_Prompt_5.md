INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this conversation is being recorded for internal process-review purposes, and it's fine to speak candidly about decisions, including ones that didn't pan out the way you expected. Can you start by telling me your role and how you got pulled into the micro-pitting issue on the anodizing line?

Participant: Sure. I'm the process engineer responsible for surface treatment qualification on new equipment. I got pulled in when QA flagged intermittent pitting on aluminum brackets coming off the new anodizing line — this was about three weeks before a customer PPAP submission, so there wasn't a lot of slack in the schedule.

Interviewer: Walk me through what happened when you were first assigned.

Participant: The first thing on my desk that morning was a handoff note from the night-shift operator saying the bath temperature had spiked overnight and he suspected that was causing the pitting. That made immediate sense to me — anodizing bath temperature is a classic culprit for pitting, it's easy to check, and it fit a story I could act on right away. So I started there. I pulled the chiller maintenance history and had our tech verify the temperature controller. There was actually a short rectifier-log summary sitting in the same folder that flagged a calibration deviation from a few days earlier, but I didn't open it that week — the temperature story was already the frame I was working from, so the chiller took priority and the rectifier note just sat there.

Interviewer: What was your objective at that point?

Participant: Just to stop the bleeding — figure out the root cause fast enough that we could run a clean trial lot and still hit the PPAP window.

Interviewer: Let's reconstruct the timeline a bit before we get into specifics. What information did you have on day one versus what came later?

Participant: Day one, I had the operator's note, the unopened rectifier summary, and a defect-rate report showing day-shift batches were pitting more than night-shift batches. Coil certs also existed but I hadn't reviewed them. Within about a day we fixed the chiller and temperatures stabilized. But pitting didn't disappear — it dropped, but a low rate persisted. That told me temperature wasn't the whole story. From there we moved into looking at the dosing system, since the residual defect pattern looked more like a chemistry consistency issue.

Interviewer: When you saw that day-shift batches had a higher defect rate than night-shift, what was your read on that?

Participant: Honestly, my first instinct was that the day-shift operator was less careful — he's newer, and I'd noticed him rushing rack loading a couple times. I flagged it in my notes as a contributing factor. Looking back, I didn't spend much time asking whether the equipment was in worse condition during the day, or whether the chemistry itself might drift over the course of a shift. I focused on him.

Interviewer: Did you consider other explanations for that gap?

Participant: Not seriously at the time, no. It seemed like a reasonably clean explanation given what I'd observed of him.

Interviewer: Let's move to the second decision — selecting a corrective dosing technology. What were you weighing?

Participant: Once we knew residual pitting was chemistry-related, we needed a better dosing control system. There were two options. Vendor A had an automated retrofit already running at three of our sister plants. Vendor B had a newer inline sensor-based system with a stronger spec sheet on paper — actually stronger on the sensing and control criteria we cared about most — but only one reference installation, and their documentation was thin, with gaps in the install manual and unclear commissioning steps.

Interviewer: How did you decide between them?

Participant: I called a couple of engineers at sister plants, and they were generally happy with Vendor A — three plants running it gave me some confidence it was a known quantity. We'd started a requirement-by-requirement comparison of the two systems, and early on it was actually tilting toward Vendor B on the technical side. But once I had three sister plants confirming Vendor A worked, that was enough for me — I didn't finish walking through the rest of the comparison. Vendor B's applications engineer even offered to walk us through the open commissioning questions, and there wasn't any identified incompatibility, but the unresolved gaps still felt less acceptable to me than Vendor A's familiar unknowns, so I didn't take him up on it.

Interviewer: Did anything about Vendor A's track record give you pause?

Participant: One of the three plants had reported mixed results with it. I knew that going in. But with three plants running it versus one incomplete installation elsewhere, it felt like the safer bet.

Interviewer: What happened after installation?

Participant: Retrofit went in within three days. First two batches still showed minor pitting, which was a little concerning. Then the next five batches came back completely clean.

Interviewer: What was your interpretation of that pattern?

Participant: Honestly, after those two rough batches, having five clean ones in a row felt like the process had settled the score — like whatever bad luck or instability had been in the system early on had been used up, so another rough batch felt a lot less likely right then. I remember telling the quality manager the odds of another bad one showing up were pretty low, given the run we'd had.

Interviewer: Did you complete the full SPC sample size that's normally recommended before declaring a process stable?

Participant: No, we hadn't hit the full sample yet. We started prepping the certification paperwork in parallel because the timeline demanded it, not because I was ready to call the process stable — I was still treating that call as open. The streak affected my gut read more than it should have, but the certification-prep timing itself was really about the calendar.

Interviewer: Was there anything else happening during that same window that could have contributed to the improvement?

Participant: There was a routine bath chemistry replenishment scheduled in there too. But honestly, I attributed most of the turnaround to the manual rectifier voltage adjustments I was making between runs — small tweaks based on how the previous batch looked. I felt like I was actively steering it back into spec. I never really separated the two effects out.

Interviewer: That leads to the final decision — signing off for PPAP. What did that process look like?

Participant: We had a full two-week trial dataset with real variability in the earlier lots, and then a final validation lot the day before the deadline that came back completely clean. The customer SQE needed the sign-off memo within 24 hours.

Interviewer: How did you weigh the earlier variability against that final lot?

Participant: The final lot was really what tipped my confidence. It was the cleanest result we'd seen, run right before submission, so it felt like the truest picture of where the process actually stood. I referenced the earlier trial data in the memo, but the final lot carried most of the weight in my recommendation to certify.

Interviewer: Was there any other data available at that point, like the Cpk finding from the independent audit?

Participant: There was a marginal Cpk result from a quality audit, yes, but it had been filed separately from the sign-off packet, so it wasn't front and center when I was writing the recommendation.

Interviewer: Under less time pressure, would you have handled that differently?

Participant: Maybe. I think I would have pulled that Cpk data into the memo directly rather than letting the last lot speak for itself.

Interviewer: Let me ask a couple of hypotheticals. If you'd reviewed the rectifier calibration logs before the operator's temperature note, do you think the investigation would have unfolded differently?

Participant: Possibly — if the rectifier deviation had been the first thing in front of me, I probably would have chased that first instead of the chiller. It's hard to say which one I'd have found more compelling, but the order I got things in definitely shaped where I looked first.

Interviewer: And if that final validation lot had shown pitting instead of coming back clean?

Participant: Then I'd have had to delay and either extend the deadline or issue something conditional. It would have forced a harder look at the full dataset rather than leaning on one result.

Interviewer: Looking back, is there anything about how you weighed the evidence you'd reconsider?

Participant: Probably how much credit I gave myself for the manual adjustments versus the chemistry replenishment — I never really separated those out. And I'd want to revisit that attribution I made about the day-shift operator; I never fully ruled out equipment or process factors there. I'd also go back and actually open that rectifier summary on day one instead of letting the first explanation carry the week. Otherwise, given the time we had, I think the calls were defensible.

Interviewer: That's a helpful place to stop. Thanks for walking through this in detail.

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{IP_Biased_7}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Industrial Production Processes}}",
  "role": "{{Process/Manufacturing Engineer (Process Selection)}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
