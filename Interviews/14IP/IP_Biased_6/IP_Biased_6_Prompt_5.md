INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this is a routine debrief on how you handled scheduling decisions during that disruption a few weeks back — Press 3 and the coil-steel delay. Nothing you say here affects performance review, I just want to understand how you actually worked through it. Sound okay?

Participant: Sure, happy to walk through it. It was a fairly full week.

Interviewer: Can you start by telling me who you are and what your role was during this incident?

Participant: I'm the PPC analyst for the stamping shop — I own the rolling five-day schedule across Press 1, 2, and 3, and I coordinate with the three downstream assembly plants that pull from us. That week my job was basically to keep the master schedule intact despite two things going sideways at once.

Interviewer: Let's get the full account first, then we'll go back through it in detail. What happened?

Participant: It started Monday morning. We had a weekend demand surge from one of the assembly plants — they needed an extra batch of the high-volume bracket variant, and Press 3 is the only press currently tooled for that part. I pulled up last week's throughput report and Press 3 had actually run above target, so capacity-wise it looked like the obvious answer. Before I locked anything in, I did get a short heads-up line from the scheduling assistant saying Press 3 had an open vibration advisory — not the full CMMS entry, just a flag. It read as low-priority, and set against how strong the throughput numbers were, it didn't seem like something that should change the call. So I allocated the full extra batch to Press 3.

Then Tuesday, our coil-steel supplier called in a four-day delay. Their rep mentioned "internal allocation constraints," which didn't mean much to me at the time. I've dealt with this supplier for a while — they've had two delays before, both around late December and late June, and both times it sorted itself out within a week without us needing backup stock. Their delays always seem to cluster around certain stretches for them, so I read the timing itself as the real signal — the "internal allocation constraints" line sounded like their usual wording, not something new. So I figured this would follow the same pattern. I did reach out to our backup supplier contact just to have something in reserve, but honestly I called the first person on my list rather than shopping around — we were already stretched that day.

By Thursday, the reliability engineer sent an update saying Press 3's vibration had ticked up slightly since the weekend run. There's a full trend log you can pull that shows three weeks of data, but I didn't open it. Partly because things were moving fast, partly because the number itself wasn't dramatic — nothing like the Press 1 incident a couple years back, which is the kind of thing that jumps to mind when I think "serious press problem." This felt more like background noise.

Then Friday morning, right before I finalized the week's schedule, engineering upgraded Press 3 from "monitor" to "elevated concern." When I asked what that actually meant, the engineer said it reflected a real increase in loading risk, not just a status update on paper. At that point the schedule was basically locked — downstream plants already had confirmation — and shifting the remaining volume to Press 1 would have meant a partial changeover costing several hours. I trimmed Friday's Press 3 run a bit but kept the plan mostly as it was.

Interviewer: Let's reconstruct that timeline a bit more precisely. What did you actually have in front of you Monday morning, before you made the allocation call?

Participant: The throughput report from the prior week, the demand surge notice from the assembly plant, the fact that Press 3 was the only tooled option, and that brief note flagging the vibration advisory. The full CMMS detail wasn't something I pulled up — I just had the short flag.

Interviewer: And the vibration advisory — how did that information reach you in more detail?

Participant: The maintenance tech mentioned more of it in passing, after the allocation was already set, saying there'd be a follow-up inspection recommended within two weeks. It wasn't presented as urgent even then.

Interviewer: When did you first hear about the supplier delay, and what was your first reaction?

Participant: Tuesday, from their account rep directly. My first thought was, "this looks like the same thing that happened in December and June."

Interviewer: Let's go back to the Monday allocation decision. What alternatives did you actually weigh?

Participant: I considered splitting the batch — running part on a temporarily retooled Press 1 and a reduced run on Press 3 — or pushing part of the order to the following week. But the changeover cost and the tight timeline made Press 3 alone the cleanest option.

Interviewer: What made the throughput report feel like the deciding piece of evidence, given you also had that vibration flag?

Participant: It was recent, it was concrete, and it directly answered the question I was asking — can Press 3 handle more volume. The flag was there, but it was low-priority and vague next to a full week of solid output numbers, so the throughput report just carried more weight for me.

Interviewer: On the supplier delay — walk me through the reasoning that led you to wait rather than order backup stock right away.

Participant: The pattern matched what I'd seen twice before with this supplier, so I expected a similar resolution — to me the timing itself was the tell, more than anything they actually said. Their rep's line about "internal allocation constraints" sounded like the kind of thing they always say around these stretches, so it didn't register as pointing to anything different this time.

Interviewer: And the choice of backup contact — what determined which supplier you called?

Participant: Honestly, it's the one I already had a relationship with. I didn't compare lead times or pricing against other options that morning — there wasn't a clean window to do that kind of comparison shopping with everything else going on.

Interviewer: Thursday's vibration note — what determined whether you pulled the full trend log? Do you think opening it would have changed what you had to do that day?

Participant: I had the update in front of me, and I made a call not to dig further right then. If I'm honest, part of it was that pulling three weeks of data might have shown a clearer upward line than a single number did, and that could have meant reworking Friday's plan on top of everything else already moving. The bi-weekly review was close enough that it felt fine to let it sit until then.

Interviewer: What situation were you picturing when you assessed how serious it might be?

Participant: If I'm honest, I was thinking of the Press 1 fire from a couple years ago — that's the reference point that comes to mind when someone says "press failure." This didn't look anything like that, so it didn't register as urgent.

Interviewer: Friday, when the status moved to "elevated concern" — how did you weigh that against the schedule you'd already committed to?

Participant: At that point we were locked in with the downstream plants, and a full reallocation meant hours of changeover we didn't have room for. Even with the engineer telling me it reflected a real risk increase, the earlier data — the throughput numbers, the clean weekend run — still felt like the more solid read on how Press 3 actually performs, so I didn't weight the new label as heavily as what I already had. I trimmed the Friday run slightly rather than overhauling the plan.

Interviewer: What would have had to be different in that assessment for you to change the schedule more substantially?

Participant: Probably if the language had been stronger — something like an explicit downtime risk instead of "elevated concern" — or if it had come earlier in the week when I had more room to maneuver.

Interviewer: What actually happened with Press 3 and the shipments that week?

Participant: Press 3 finished the week without failing. The reliability engineer did file a formal recommendation to reduce loading next cycle. Shipments went out on time to all three plants.

Interviewer: If that Monday flag had appeared directly inside your scheduling dashboard instead of arriving as a separate message from the scheduling assistant, do you think the allocation decision would have gone differently?

Participant: Possibly. If it had been sitting right there next to the throughput numbers instead of coming in as a separate note, I think I'd have paused longer on it instead of leaning mainly on the report.

Interviewer: If you'd had unlimited time that week, is there anything you'd have checked differently?

Participant: I'd have pulled the full trend log Thursday instead of going off the single update, and I probably would have called around to compare backup suppliers instead of just going with who I knew.

Interviewer: Last one — looking back, what's one thing about how information reached you that you'd want changed?

Participant: Honestly, just having the maintenance advisories show up in full where I'm already doing my scheduling. Right now I mostly get a quick flag and have to go looking for the rest, and that week, I didn't.

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{IP_Biased_6}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Industrial Production Processes}}",
  "role": "{{Production Planning and Control (PPC) Analyst}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
