INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Before we start, I want to confirm you're okay with this being used for a maintenance decision-making review, and that we can reference the tail number and event details generically without naming crew.

Participant: That's fine, go ahead.

Interviewer: Great. Can you tell me your role and how you came into this event?

Participant: I'm the Director of Maintenance at our base station. I oversee line maintenance sign-offs, RTS certifications, and I'm the one who ultimately owns whether an aircraft goes back into the schedule. This one landed on my desk because it kept coming back.

Interviewer: Walk me through what the issue looked like when you first became aware of it.

Participant: We had a Hydraulic System B caution light show up on one of our E175s—momentary, cleared itself, crew wrote it up. Maintenance ran the BITE test, came back clean, no fault found. Classic CND. It happened three times over about two weeks. Each time, no fluid loss, nothing on inspection, so operationally we didn't have grounds to restrict it under the MEL. The aircraft kept flying its line.

Interviewer: What did you make of that pattern at the time?

Participant: Intermittent hydraulic caution lights aren't unusual, honestly. Sensors can be noisy, especially early in a duty cycle. Each event was short—two seconds, three seconds, then about five—and with nothing showing on inspection, my read was this was probably a nuisance signal that would settle down on its own once we cycled the system a few more times. We had the holiday peak coming up and needed the airframe in rotation, so grounding it for an open-ended isolation hunt on a CND item felt like overkill at that point.

Interviewer: Did the increasing duration register as significant to you?

Participant: I noticed it, sure. But two to five seconds isn't a big jump in absolute terms, and without any corroborating fluid or pressure data, I didn't see it as a trend that was going anywhere serious. I figured we'd keep an eye on it.

Interviewer: What happened next?

Participant: Next flight day, it came back a fourth time, and this one ran about twelve seconds—longer than anything before—and the crew also noted a brief speed brake anomaly on the same leg. That's when my senior hydraulics engineer came to me and wanted to pull the aircraft and run the full fault isolation procedure out of the FIM.

Interviewer: What did you decide at that point, and how did you get there?

Participant: While we were talking about it, our OEM field rep happened to be at the hangar working a different tail. I flagged him down and asked what he thought. He said he'd seen this pattern before—some kind of software or BITE quirk that another operator's fleet had flagged in a service bulletin, and that a reset usually cleared it up. One of my own guys also remembered we'd had something similar in-house a while back, a caution light that went away after a reset and never came back. Between the OEM read and that memory, it felt like we already had the answer, so I told my engineer we'd hold off on the full isolation, do the reset, and keep flying it.

Interviewer: How did your engineer take that?

Participant: He wasn't thrilled. He felt the speed brake anomaly changed the picture and wanted the formal procedure regardless. But the OEM rep works this aircraft type across a lot of operators, so I leaned toward his read over running a full teardown-style isolation on a holiday week.

Interviewer: What information did you weigh most heavily there, and what didn't you dig into?

Participant: Honestly, the OEM rep's experience and the in-house case were what tipped it. I didn't go back and check whether that old in-house case actually matched this one on flight hours or component batch—it just felt like the same animal. We reset the BITE and flew it two cycles without a recurrence.

Interviewer: What came after that?

Participant: A few days later, during an unrelated task, one of the techs was near the hydraulic pump and noticed some residue around the seal. Small amount, hadn't been documented before. That was new—nothing like that had shown up in any of the earlier CND checks.

Interviewer: What did that change for you?

Participant: It told us there might be an actual mechanical source rather than just a sensor quirk. At that point we'd already put about fourteen hours into troubleshooting—swapped the accumulator, replaced a sensor—chasing the original plan. Full pump replacement would've meant more downtime and we didn't have the part on the shelf yet. Since we were most of the way through the incremental plan already, and the residue was minor, I decided to just replace the seal and finish what we'd started rather than open up a bigger job.

Interviewer: Did the amount of work already done factor into that choice?

Participant: I'd say it factored in some. We'd sunk real hours into the path we were on, and pulling the pump entirely would've meant some of that work was for nothing. The seal fix looked like it would close it out without starting over.

Interviewer: After the seal replacement, what did you see?

Participant: Leak check passed on the ground, static test showed no residue. Clean.

Interviewer: What happened at the final sign-off?

Participant: We needed the aircraft that afternoon for the holiday schedule, and we didn't have a test-flight crew available same-day. Ground data looked good—leak check passed, static test clean—so I signed the RTS certification. I told the ops desk I was confident this was resolved.

Interviewer: Given the aircraft's history—three CND events, the fourth longer one with the speed brake note, and the fact that the seal residue never really explained why the caution happened in flight in the first place—how sure were you that this was actually fixed?

Participant: Pretty sure, honestly. I knew the ground checks couldn't reproduce the exact in-flight condition that triggered the caution—static testing just isn't the same environment. But a passed leak check is normally what we'd treat as proof a leak-based repair worked, and I didn't see a reason to hold the airplane on top of that.

Interviewer: If you'd had a test-flight crew available that day, would that have changed your certainty?

Participant: It would've been a nice extra data point, but I don't think it would've changed my decision to release it.

Interviewer: Looking back across the whole event, is there a point where, with the same information you had then, you'd make a different call?

Participant: Maybe the fourth event—the twelve-second one with the speed brake anomaly. If I'd leaned more toward my engineer's read there instead of the OEM rep's, we might have caught the seal issue earlier instead of a few days later.

Interviewer: If the OEM rep hadn't been on-site that day, what do you think you'd have done instead?

Participant: Probably would've let my engineer run the full isolation. Having an outside read available in the moment made it easy to go a different direction.

Interviewer: Last one—if the seal residue had turned up before you'd started the component swaps, would the escalation decision have gone differently?

Participant: Probably, yeah. Coming in fresh, without hours already spent, I think full pump replacement looks more obviously like the right call.

  "interview_id": "{{AV_Biased_5}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Aviation}}",
  "role": "{{Director of Maintenance (DOM)}}"

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
