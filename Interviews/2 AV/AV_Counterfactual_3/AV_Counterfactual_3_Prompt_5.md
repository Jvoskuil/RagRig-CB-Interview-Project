INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just so you know, I'll ask you to walk through a specific turnaround and explain your thinking as it unfolded, not just what ended up happening. Can you tell me your role and a bit about your background?

Participant: Sure. I've been a load controller about nine years, mostly narrow-body combi work. Normally I build the load sheet, issue the loading instruction to the ramp, check weight and balance against structural limits, and finalize the NOTOC for the captain. This one wasn't a normal turn, though—the inbound aircraft came in late, so instead of our usual 45 minutes on the ground, we were looking at more like 30 before the slot.

Interviewer: How did that change things going in?

Participant: Right away I knew I'd be compressing steps I'd normally spread out a bit more. Nothing about the flight itself was unusual—same route, same aircraft type—it was just less time to work with.

Interviewer: Walk me through what happened.

Participant: I got the cargo manifest with about 30 minutes left. Mixed load—regular bags, some mail, and one item that stood out: a piece of machinery, irregular shape, heavier than what typically goes through, not palletized. Our load-control software generates an automatic load instruction, and it put that machinery item into hold 3. That system's been reliable for this fleet for as long as I've used it, and with the clock already working against us, I issued the ALI to the ramp basically as generated so they could start loading immediately. About fifteen minutes later, the ramp called and said the aircraft was sitting slightly tail-heavy—not out of limits, just aft of where you'd expect.

Interviewer: What did you do with that?

Participant: Logged it and kept going, because right then an LMC came in—about 380 kilos of mail plus six late bags that missed the original manifest. That mail got assigned to hold 5, our aft bulk hold. With the time we had left, I looked at the total weight, saw it was in line with the LMCs we'd been getting all week on this route—three similar ones, same range, none of those needed redistribution—and cleared it on that basis so I could move to the trim sheet.

Interviewer: And the trim sheet itself?

Participant: I pulled the dispatch log for a quick check, given the tail-heavy call from the ramp. Saw the previous two flights on this same rotation—different tails, one to a different destination—had both needed aft trim corrections. With barely any time left before I had to finalize, that plus the ramp's report was enough for me to treat the rotation as running tail-heavy that day, so I shifted some cargo forward beyond what my own index actually required.

Interviewer: Let's go through each of those moments in more detail. Starting with the ALI and the machinery item—what specifically told you it was fine to run with as generated?

Participant: Mostly the system's history—it's been solid on this fleet for months. I did notice the item was irregular, not on a pallet, heavier than usual. That registered. But with only 30 minutes and the ramp already waiting, stopping to hand-verify felt like it would eat time I didn't have, so I went with what the system gave me.

Interviewer: Was there a manual chart you could have checked against for that kind of cargo?

Participant: There is, for exactly that situation. I know where it is. I just didn't reach for it that day.

Interviewer: What would have made you stop and pull it?

Participant: If we'd had the full 45, probably. Or if the system itself had thrown some kind of flag saying this needs manual sign-off. Neither of those happened, so I treated it like any other ALI.

Interviewer: On the LMC—what exactly did you compare when the mail and bags came in?

Participant: Total weight against what we'd seen from this week's other LMCs. That was the number I had on hand and could check fastest.

Interviewer: Did you look at where hold 5 sits relative to where those earlier LMCs went?

Participant: No, not specifically. The earlier ones went forward, into hold 2 I believe. This one went aft, into 5. I didn't run the index shift for that particular placement—the weight matched what I'd seen before, and with the time squeeze, that's what I used to clear it.

Interviewer: What would it have taken to run that calculation directly?

Participant: A few extra minutes at the trim computer. It wasn't unavailable to me. I just didn't think it was worth the time against the schedule we were on.

Interviewer: On the trim sheet redistribution—how did you connect the two previous flights to this one?

Participant: They were on the same rotation, back to back, and both needed aft correction. Two in a row felt like it meant something about how the rotation was running that day, so I built in a forward shift before signing off, and honestly, with the time we had left, I didn't feel like there was room to dig into it further.

Interviewer: What did your own calculated index for this flight show on its own?

Participant: It was fine—within the normal forward range with margin. The redistribution wasn't because my numbers were bad. It was more that seeing two prior aft trims made me not fully trust it, and I didn't have the minutes to sit with that discomfort.

Interviewer: Did you find out afterward why those two flights ran tail-heavy?

Participant: Yeah—one was a fuel imbalance, the other had extra catering loaded late. Different tails, unrelated causes. Nothing tying them to each other or to this flight.

Interviewer: Last one—the final sign-off. What was the situation?

Participant: Closeout figures looked clean, within limits. But the ramp tally was one bag short of the NOTOC and manifest. Small discrepancy, and the slot was closing faster than a normal turn would allow.

Interviewer: What did you decide, and what were you weighing?

Participant: I signed and released with the figures as they stood. I weighed the delay risk against a one-bag discrepancy that's usually just a miscount, not a safety concern by itself. It turned out to be a manifest correction afterward—the weight and balance conclusion didn't change. I can see someone holding a couple minutes to chase it down instead. Neither call feels obviously wrong to me.

Interviewer: How confident were you in each of these at the time, versus now?

Participant: The ALI and the LMC, fairly confident in the moment, more than I'd be now looking back. The trim redistribution, less sure even then—it felt like caution more than certainty. The sign-off, I'm still not positive I made the better call, but I don't think it was unreasonable given the time.

Interviewer: If you'd had the full 45 minutes instead of 30, would you have handled the machinery cargo differently?

Participant: Probably, yes. I think I'd have pulled the manual chart. The shorter window is what pushed me to just trust the system's history instead.

Interviewer: If the mail had gone to the usual forward hold instead of hold 5?

Participant: Then the weight comparison would've actually held up fine, since placement wouldn't have mattered as much. It was the aft location that made that comparison misleading, not the comparison itself.

Interviewer: If you'd known upfront the two prior tail-heavy events were unrelated, would you have redistributed the same way?

Participant: No. I'd have trusted my own numbers for this flight instead of layering in a correction based on two other tails.

Interviewer: Anything you'd do differently facing this same sequence again, under the same shortened window?

Participant: Pull the manual chart for anything irregular no matter how tight the clock is, and keep this flight's numbers separate from what happened on previous ones unless I actually know there's a shared cause. The LMC piece I'd still have to think through—weight alone wasn't the full story that day, and less time made that easier to miss, not harder.

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{AV_Counterfactual_3}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Aviation}}",
  "role": "{{Load Controller / Loadmaster (Commercial)}}"
}

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
