INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this conversation is being recorded for a post-event learning review, not for disciplinary purposes, and you're free to skip anything you're not comfortable discussing. Can you start by telling me your role and what you were assigned that shift?

Participant: Sure, no problem. I'm a field equipment operator, been doing this about eleven years now, mostly auxiliary systems. That shift I was assigned to restore AFW Pump Train B to service after maintenance had a check valve out for repair. Goal was straightforward: get the lineup verified, start the pump, run the post-maintenance test, and get it inside the surveillance window before the LCO clock ran out.

Interviewer: Can you walk me through what happened, from the beginning?

Participant: I got to the pump room after grabbing the surveillance procedure and the routine lineup checklist. I'd done this exact lineup more times than I can count, so I started working through it the way I always do, valve by valve, left side first, then across to the discharge header. Somewhere in there, the prior shift had mentioned during turnover that maintenance added an isolation valve downstream of the check valve for the repair, but it was just a quick verbal mention in passing, not something we sat down and reviewed. I kept moving through my normal sequence. When I got near where that valve should've been, I didn't stop to pull the work order attachment and check it — I just verified it looked roughly right and kept going. Found out afterward, when control room called down, that it wasn't lined up the way the updated paperwork called for.

After we sorted that out, I started the pump. On startup, the bearing temperature RTD came up slightly above the normal band, not alarming, but above where I usually see it. My first thought honestly went back to the week before — we'd had a similar RTD on another pump throw a high reading that turned out to be a wiring fault, nothing physically wrong with the pump. So I figured this was probably the same kind of thing and didn't pull up the trend data right then. I just kept an eye on it informally and moved on with startup.

A little later, doing my rounds near the pump coupling, I heard a pretty loud, intermittent knocking sound. That got my attention immediately, it's the kind of noise that makes you stop. I also noticed, if I think back on it, the temperature had drifted up a bit more on the local gauge, and there was a faint odor near the oil reservoir. But the noise was what stood out, so that's what I focused on and what I called up to the control room about.

Interviewer: Let's slow down and go through the sequence again. What was the first point where you noticed something outside the routine?

Participant: Really it was the turnover mention of the added valve, though at the time it didn't register as a big deal. Then the RTD reading on startup was the next thing. Then the noise during rounds. Then it all came together near the end when we had to decide whether to keep running or trip the train, with the surveillance window closing in under half an hour.

Interviewer: Let's go through each of those decisions in more detail. Starting with the valve lineup — what information did you have in front of you at that point?

Participant: I had the standard checklist, the verbal mention from turnover about the new valve, and technically the work order attachment was available if I'd gone looking for it.

Interviewer: What made you proceed with the standard sequence instead of stopping to check the attachment?

Participant: Honestly, it's just the sequence I run every time, it's second nature at this point. The mention at turnover registered, but it didn't trigger me to break from the pattern. I've done that lineup so many times the same way, my hands almost know it before my head catches up.

Interviewer: Had you handled an added or modified valve in a lineup before?

Participant: Occasionally, yeah, and usually turnover flags it clearly enough that I stop. This time it came up quick, almost an afterthought, and I didn't treat it any differently than a normal round.

Interviewer: Moving to the bearing temperature reading — what sources of information did you check, and which did you not check?

Participant: I checked the immediate RTD reading, which was slightly elevated. I did not pull the fifteen-minute trend from the plant computer, even though it was right there available. I relied more on remembering that other pump's issue from the week before.

Interviewer: How confident were you that this was the same kind of issue?

Participant: Confident enough to not escalate it right away, but not certain. If you'd asked me right then, I'd have said probably instrumentation again, but I couldn't have shown you data to back that up.

Interviewer: Let's talk about the noise, temperature drift, and odor. What made you center your report on the noise?

Participant: It's just impossible to ignore, it's loud, it's rhythmic, it sounds mechanical and wrong. The temperature drift was smaller and only visible if you were looking right at the local gauge, and the odor was faint enough that I almost second-guessed whether I was smelling anything at all. So naturally the noise is what I led with on the radio.

Interviewer: Did you weigh the three cues equally before reporting?

Participant: Not really equally, no. I mentioned the other two, but briefly, more like a footnote to the noise call.

Interviewer: Now the final decision — continue running or trip and swap trains. What did that look like?

Participant: We had maybe under thirty minutes left in the window. I had a partial picture — noise that turned out later to be a loose coupling guard, a temperature that had crept up some more, and that odor still there. Swapping trains meant coordination, paperwork, and possibly missing the window entirely. The Shift Technical Advisor was tied up on another issue. I put together what I had, decided it was workable, and kept the train running to finish the test on schedule.

Interviewer: Did you consider pulling a full vibration spectrum or an oil sample before deciding?

Participant: I thought about it, yeah. There probably was time if I'd pushed for it, but between the clock and coordinating with everyone else, I went with what I already had rather than chasing every possible check.

Interviewer: Was there a quicker option available — say, a fast local vibration reading or a quick radio consultation with someone in the control room — that might have told you within a few minutes whether this was the loose guard or something developing in the bearing itself?

Participant: Looking back, yeah, there probably was. A quick local vibration check wouldn't have taken long, and I could have gotten someone on the radio to sanity-check what I was seeing. I didn't actually ask whether that was doable in the moment — once I had the pieces I'd already gathered, it felt like enough to keep going, so I didn't stop to find out if a faster check could have fit inside the window.

Interviewer: If the work order attachment had been physically handed to you at turnover instead of just mentioned, do you think anything would have changed?

Participant: Probably. If it's in my hand, I'm looking at it. Verbal mentions in a busy turnover just don't stick the same way.

Interviewer: If that other pump's false alarm hadn't happened the week before, would you have responded to the RTD differently?

Participant: That's a fair question. I think I might have pulled the trend sooner instead of assuming it was the same story.

Interviewer: If the knocking noise had been quieter, do you think the temperature trend would have gotten more attention?

Participant: Probably, yeah. It's hard not to chase the loudest thing in the room first.

Interviewer: Looking back, is there anything you'd do differently with the same information you had at the time?

Participant: I'd probably slow down at the valve lineup regardless of how routine it feels, and I'd pull the trend data earlier instead of leaning on what happened last week. The bearing ended up needing unplanned maintenance for degrading lubrication, so there was more going on than I gave it credit for in the moment.}}

OPTIONAL METADATA

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
