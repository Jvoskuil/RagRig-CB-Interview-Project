INTERVIEW
{{Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this is a routine cognitive task analysis interview — I'm trying to understand your reasoning process during the AFW procedure revision, not evaluating performance. Everything stays de-identified in my notes. Sound okay?

Participant: Sure, that's fine. Happy to walk through it.

Interviewer: Great. Can you start by telling me what this revision was for and why it came up?

Participant: So we had a design change package come through — the legacy analog level transmitter on one of the AFW trains got swapped for a new digital unit. Different response curve, different failure modes than what the old EOP steps were written around. My job was to update the Emergency Operating Procedure sequence so the initiation steps matched the new instrumentation, get it through V&V and human-factors review, and have it ready before the outage window opened. We had about three days.

Interviewer: What was your main objective going in?

Participant: Get an accurate, defensible procedure revision done on time. Accurate matters obviously, but the deadline was real — outage planning had already built the implementation window around this, so slipping it wasn't really an option without a whole scheduling conversation nobody wanted to have.

Interviewer: Walk me through the incident from the beginning.

Participant: Right when I started, an industry OE report landed in my queue — a transmitter failure at another station involving a new digital level transmitter. My first reaction was, okay, this is directly relevant, new digital unit, level transmitter, similar failure. I started pulling language from it into my draft pretty quickly. It was only later, when I looped in the I&C engineer who'd actually executed our design change, that he pointed out the OE unit used a different sensing technology than ours — different vendor family entirely. So the applicability wasn't as clean as I'd assumed.

From there I moved into drafting the actual verification steps. The new transmitter needed a two-point calibration check that the old analog unit never required. I've written a lot of these AFW revisions over the years, so I built the verification section using the template sequence I normally use. That went to peer review, and the reviewer caught that the calibration check wasn't in there at all — I'd basically carried over the old pattern without building it fresh around the new requirement.

Interviewer: What happened next?

Participant: I had to set validation criteria — basically, what surveillance test data to use as the benchmark for confirming the new steps work as intended. We've got five years of AFW surveillance history, but I also had a test from two weeks earlier on a different, unrelated procedure that happened to use a similar-looking verification form. That one was fresh in my head, so I anchored the validation criteria around it. Turned out later, when someone did a fuller data pull, that some of the older historical tests actually covered operating conditions closer to this transmitter's actual fault signature than the recent one did.

Interviewer: And the final stretch?

Participant: Last day, deadline under 24 hours out. I wanted to check the OE database more thoroughly, but part of it was locked because of a concurrent audit. So I worked off what I had — control room log, my own notes — and judged that was enough to close it out. I did a mental run-through of the failure modes and figured we'd covered the main ones, so I signed off and sent it to the approval board. They came back afterward asking for a supplemental risk note because there was a failure mode the draft hadn't addressed.

Interviewer: Let's go back to that OE report moment. What specifically made you decide it applied to your transmitter?

Participant: Honestly, the framing — "new digital level transmitter failure" — matched our situation closely enough that it registered as the same kind of event. I didn't stop to verify the sensing technology before I started drafting around it. In hindsight I probably should've asked the I&C engineer first, but it read as applicable on its face.

Interviewer: What alternatives did you consider there?

Participant: I could've tabled it as low relevance until I confirmed equivalence, or gone straight to the I&C engineer before touching the draft. I didn't do either — I just moved forward with incorporating it.

Interviewer: On the verification steps — what sources did you actually rely on when drafting?

Participant: Mostly my own prior work. I've done this enough times that I have a rhythm to how these sections get built. I did have the design change package open, but I wrote the structure first and meant to reconcile it against the specific requirements after — that reconciliation step is where the calibration check got missed.

Interviewer: Was consulting the I&C engineer before drafting ever on the table?

Participant: It was an option. I just didn't think I needed it at that stage — this felt like standard territory.

Interviewer: How did you decide which historical test data to weight most heavily for the validation criteria?

Participant: The two-week-old test was just top of mind — I'd looked at that form recently for something else, and it seemed like a reasonable proxy. I didn't go back and systematically compare it against the older data set for relevance to this transmitter's specific fault modes. In hindsight, the older data had more operating conditions represented.

Interviewer: When time got short at the end, how did you decide the draft was ready to submit?

Participant: I looked at what was actually accessible — the control room log, my notes — and it felt like enough to call it done. The audit had the fuller OE records locked up, and requesting an extension felt like it would just push the whole outage schedule, so I didn't pursue that. On the risk side, I ran through the failure modes I could recall from the design package, felt like the major ones were addressed, and made the call that residual risk was acceptable.

Interviewer: Did escalating to the Shift Technical Advisor come up as an option?

Participant: It did cross my mind, but I didn't think the open question was significant enough to escalate at the time.

Interviewer: If you'd had another full day for the OE report review, would you have handled that differently?

Participant: Probably — I'd have gotten the I&C engineer's read on technical equivalence before drafting anything, rather than after.

Interviewer: If the audit hadn't locked the database, what would you have checked?

Participant: I'd have wanted to search for any other OE items involving this exact transmitter model, and cross-check the failure-mode list more completely instead of relying on memory.

Interviewer: Looking back, is there a point you'd have wanted a second set of eyes earlier?

Participant: Probably right after the OE report came in, before I started building language around it.

Interviewer: How confident were you in that final risk judgment at the time, compared to now?

Participant: At the time, reasonably confident — it felt sufficient given what I had access to. Now, knowing the board found a gap, I'd say I was more confident than the evidence actually supported.

Interviewer: That's really helpful. Thanks for walking through all of that in detail.}}

OPTIONAL METADATA
The following metadata may help identify the setting but must not determine the classification:
{
  "interview_id": "{{NP_Biased_5}}",
  "occupational_domain": "{{Nuclear power and Process-control operations}}",
  "role": "{{Procedure Engineer / Technical Procedure Writer}}"

TAXONOMY

This taxonomy distinguishes three aspects of work:

1. Task content: what the worker does.
2. Work methods: how the work is organised.
3. Tools: what machinery or technology is used.

Classify only categories supported by observable evidence. Multiple categories may be present. Select one primary content category and any defensible secondary categories. Do not force a category when evidence is insufficient.

A. TASK CONTENT — WHAT THE WORKER DOES

A1. PHYSICAL TASKS

A1.1 Strength
The worker exerts physical force or effort, handles loads, pushes, pulls, lifts, carries, restrains, or uses bodily strength as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.2 Dexterity
The worker performs precise, coordinated, or fine-grained physical movements, manipulates objects or instruments, assembles, repairs, operates controls manually, or uses hand-eye coordination as a meaningful part of the task.

A1.3 Navigation
The worker physically moves through or around an environment, routes people or objects, or maintains orientation and position in a spatial setting as a meaningful part of the task.

A2. INTELLECTUAL TASKS

A2.1 Uncodified visual or auditory information processing
The worker interprets visual, auditory, or other perceptual information that is difficult to reduce to a fully explicit rule, including recognizing patterns, anomalies, conditions, or signals.

A2.2 Literacy
The worker reads, writes, composes, edits, interprets, or communicates using written language as a meaningful part of the task.

A2.3 Numeracy
The worker calculates, quantifies, estimates, compares numerical values, interprets numerical information, or reasons about proportions, probabilities, measurements, or financial quantities.

A2.4 Information search, retrieval, gathering, and evaluation
The worker seeks, retrieves, gathers, compares, verifies, filters, or evaluates information from records, people, systems, documents, observations, or other sources.

A2.5 Conceptualisation, learning, and abstraction
The worker forms concepts, learns from experience, generalises, diagnoses, explains relationships, builds mental models, applies abstract principles, or understands a system beyond the immediate facts.

A2.6 Creativity, planning, and resolution
The worker generates, designs, or adapts solutions to a problem; develops and compares possible courses of action; plans their implementation; anticipates dependencies or consequences; or resolves a novel, non-routine situation by combining information in an original or context-sensitive way. Planning counts when it involves organising a sequence of actions, timing, resources, contingencies, or dependencies toward a goal—not merely selecting or carrying out a routine next step.

A3. SOCIAL TASKS

A3.1 Serving and attending
The worker responds to another person's immediate needs, provides a service, receives requests, attends to a customer, patient, client, user, colleague, or member of the public, or manages an interaction aimed at assistance.

A3.2 Teaching, training, and coaching
The worker explains, instructs, demonstrates, trains, develops, mentors, or coaches another person.

A3.3 Selling and influencing
The worker persuades, negotiates, recommends, markets, advocates, manages expectations, seeks agreement, or attempts to influence another person's decision or behaviour.

A3.4 Managing and coordinating
The worker allocates work, coordinates people or activities, manages dependencies, sets priorities, resolves organisational conflicts, supervises, or aligns multiple stakeholders.

A3.5 Caring
The worker provides emotional, personal, health-related, protective, or welfare-oriented support in which attention to another person's condition or well-being is central.

B. WORK METHODS — HOW THE WORK IS ORGANISED

B1. AUTONOMY

B1.1 Latitude
The worker has discretion over objectives, priorities, timing, sequence, methods, or decisions. Classify low, moderate, or high only when the interview provides evidence about the worker's discretion.

B1.2 Control and monitoring
The worker's work is supervised, measured, audited, monitored, reviewed, or constrained by another person, policy, procedure, system, target, or formal approval process. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the strength and frequency of such control.

B2. TEAMWORK

Direct collaboration with co-workers or other actors to accomplish a shared task, exchange information, coordinate actions, hand off work, or reach a joint decision. Classify low, moderate, or high based on the worker's dependence on collaboration in the described episode.

B3. ROUTINE

B3.1 Repetitiveness
The same or highly similar actions, inputs, decisions, or outputs recur frequently.

B3.2 Standardisation
The task follows prescribed procedures, scripts, checklists, templates, rules, or consistent sequences.

B3.3 Certainty and response to unforeseen situations
Certainty refers to how predictable the relevant inputs, conditions, and consequences are. Response to unforeseen situations refers to how much the worker must handle exceptions, novelty, ambiguity, disruptions, or unexpected developments.

For this dimension, report both:
- certainty: low, moderate, high, or not_observable;
- unforeseen_response_requirement: low, moderate, high, or not_observable.

C. TOOLS — MACHINERY AND TECHNOLOGY USED

C1. Non-digital machinery
Analog or mechanical devices and machinery without meaningful digital control, sensing, computing, or networked information processing.

C2. Digitally enabled machinery
Machinery or equipment using digital control, sensors, software, automation, robotics, or networked digital systems. Classify the most specific supported subtype:

C2.1 Autonomous machinery or robots
The equipment performs meaningful operations with limited direct human control after initiation.

C2.2 Non-autonomous digitally enabled machinery
The worker directly operates or controls digitally enabled physical equipment.

C2.3 Basic ICT
Routine use of computers, smartphones, email, office software, standard databases, or basic digital communication and information systems.

C2.4 Advanced ICT or programming
Programming, data analysis, modelling, system configuration, advanced computational tools, or complex software-based information processing.

C2.5 Specialised ICT
Special-purpose professional software or digital systems used for a particular occupation or work process, where the system is more specialised than ordinary office or communication software.

C2.6 Other digitally enabled tools
Digital tools that clearly matter to the work but do not fit the preceding subcategories.

CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. Classify the described episode, not the entire occupation.
2. A category must have textual evidence. Do not infer it from the role title.
3. Assign one primary task-content category: the category most central to the operational objective and decision episode.
4. Assign secondary content categories only when they are substantively involved, not merely mentioned.
5. Content categories may come from different families. For example, an interview may contain intellectual information evaluation as primary content and social influencing as secondary content.
6. Methods and tools are separate from content. Do not label a task intellectual merely because it uses a computer, or social merely because other people are mentioned.
7. Distinguish information search/evaluation from conceptualisation: the former concerns obtaining and assessing information; the latter concerns forming models, diagnoses, abstractions, or generalisations.
8. Distinguish creativity/resolution from ordinary choice: creativity requires adaptation, novel solution generation, or non-routine problem resolution.
9. Distinguish serving/attending from selling/influencing: assistance and responsiveness are not necessarily persuasion or negotiation.
10. Distinguish managing/coordinating from teamwork: teamwork is collaboration; managing/coordinating involves organising dependencies, priorities, people, or activities.
11. Do not infer strength, dexterity, navigation, or caring without direct evidence.
12. For autonomy, monitoring, teamwork, repetitiveness, standardisation, and certainty, use `not_observable` when the interview does not support a reliable level.
13. Multiple tools may be present. Record only tools that play a meaningful role in the episode.
14. If a classification is ambiguous, record the competing categories and explain the ambiguity.
15. Do not treat the participant's cognitive bias, if any, as a task category.
16. Do not use external web research. The supplied taxonomy is the authority for this annotation.

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For every assigned content category, method level, and tool category, provide:
- a short quotation or faithful text span;
- the location, such as opening, timeline, decision point, or participant turn;
- an explanation of why the evidence supports the category;
- confidence from 0 to 100.

For categories not observed but potentially plausible, do not list them as present. Place them in `not_observed_or_insufficient` only if doing so helps explain a material ambiguity.

COVERAGE STATUS

Set `coverage_status` as follows:
- `complete`: the interview contains enough evidence to classify content, methods, and tools;
- `partial`: at least one major dimension is not observable;
- `ambiguous`: competing categories cannot be resolved from the text;
- `insufficient`: the interview does not contain a sufficiently identifiable work episode.
