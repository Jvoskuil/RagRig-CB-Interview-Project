You are an independent benchmark evaluator for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that analyzes cognitive task analysis interviews for cognitive biases.

Evaluate one RAG analysis run by comparing: (1) the raw interview, (2) its complete generation specification including hidden validation, (3) the RAG JSON output, and (4) an optional frozen evaluation segment map. Produce a machine-readable record suitable for aggregation across interviews, system prompts, corpus conditions, and confidence thresholds.

You are an evaluator, not a new cognitive-bias analyst. Do not grant credit because a prediction is plausible or scholarly sounding. Judge it against the hidden ground truth, the raw interview, and the matching rules below.

<RAW_INTERVIEW>
Interviewer: Thanks for making time for this. Just to confirm, this is a voluntary conversation about a specific project experience, it'll be recorded for research purposes, and you can skip anything you'd rather not discuss. Sound okay?

Participant: Yeah, that's fine. Happy to walk through it.

Interviewer: Great. Can you start by telling me a bit about your role and the project we're discussing?

Participant: Sure. I'm the software architect on our customer portal modernization. We were rebuilding the self-service portal for retail banking customers — new interaction design, plus re-architecting the backend off a fairly old monolith. I owned the technical direction end to end, working with a UX researcher, our backend team, security and compliance, and an external vendor who helped with the front-end migration.

Interviewer: What was the objective when the project kicked off?

Participant: We had a hard deadline — six months — tied to a regulatory reporting change, so the date wasn't negotiable. The goal was a portal that was both more usable and could scale better, since the existing system was tightly coupled to our core banking platform and every change took forever to ship.

Interviewer: Walk me through how the project actually unfolded, from your perspective.

Participant: It started with scoping. We brought in a vendor to help estimate the front-end migration piece, since we didn't have deep in-house experience with the newer framework we wanted to use. Around the same time, we kicked off early usability testing on a new navigation model I'd designed — basically restructuring how customers move between the dashboard and their account details. That ran in parallel with an architecture debate on the backend: whether to do a more conservative monolith refactor or go further and decompose into microservices. That decision took a few weeks and involved looking at what similar firms had done. Once we picked a direction, we moved into execution, and about four months in we hit some turbulence — delays, a couple of outages, and separately, a mandate from security to change our authentication approach. That's roughly the shape of it.

Interviewer: Let's go back to the very beginning — the budget number. What happened there?

Participant: Finance needed a number within about a week to lock the budget, and we didn't have a detailed internal estimate yet — that takes real engineering time to build properly. So we did a scoping call with the vendor, and they gave us a rough order-of-magnitude figure for the migration, both cost and timeline.

Interviewer: What did you do with that figure?

Participant: I used it. Submitted it as our working budget baseline since it was the only concrete number on the table and finance needed something.

Interviewer: Did you consider other options — waiting, or giving a range instead?

Participant: We could have waited two more weeks for a real internal estimate, or given a range with caveats. I thought about the range option, actually, but figured a single number would be easier for finance to plan around, and the vendor had done similar migrations before, so it seemed like a reasonable placeholder.

Interviewer: What happened once the internal team produced their own estimate?

Participant: It came in about 40% higher. Some scope items the vendor hadn't accounted for — data migration edge cases, mostly. When I brought it to finance, I remember framing it as an overrun against the original number rather than as, you know, the number we probably should have started with. It became this whole conversation about why we were 40% over, when really the vendor's figure was just thin to begin with.

Interviewer: Looking back, how much weight do you think that early vendor number carried in later conversations?

Participant: Probably more than it should have. Every budget check-in after that referenced it as the baseline, even once we knew it wasn't built on solid scoping.

Interviewer: Let's move to the usability testing. What did that process look like?

Participant: We ran a round with ten beta users on the new navigation model. Results were mixed — six of ten had trouble moving between the dashboard and account sections, four completed tasks quickly and gave positive feedback. Our UX researcher's write-up flagged the navigation confusion as the top issue.

Interviewer: How did you interpret that split?

Participant: Honestly, I went back through the transcripts looking for more of the positive comments to include in the stakeholder readout. The four successful users had some pretty specific praise for the new layout, and I wanted that represented well. For the confusion cases, my read was that a lot of it looked like people just not being used to the new pattern yet — more of an onboarding gap than a structural flaw in the design.

Interviewer: Did you apply the same level of scrutiny to the positive responses as the negative ones?

Participant: That's a fair question. I don't think I dug into the positive transcripts looking for problems the same way I dug into the negative ones looking for mitigating explanations. I was fairly confident in the navigation model going in, so I think I was reading the results through that lens somewhat.

Interviewer: What did the follow-up round show?

Participant: Similar confusion rate with a different cohort. So it wasn't a one-off.

Interviewer: Now, the architecture decision — monolith refactor versus microservices. How did that get resolved?

Participant: That one took real debate. Monolith refactor was lower risk but wouldn't buy us much scalability. Microservices was a bigger lift but matched what we'd seen at a few peer firms — three other financial companies had presented case studies on similar decompositions at a conference a few months earlier. Our own backend risk memo called the microservices path "moderate risk, manageable with phased rollout."

Interviewer: What tipped the decision toward microservices?

Participant: The peer examples carried real weight for me, honestly. If three firms our size had gone that direction and it worked out, it felt like a validated path rather than something experimental. That was alongside the internal risk memo, but I'd say the industry pattern was part of what made me comfortable recommending it.

Interviewer: Around that time there was also a demo incident. Can you describe that?

Participant: Yeah — during a live demo for the executive sponsor, one beta session crashed. Visible, in the room, bad timing. That was against a backdrop of pretty strong pilot metrics otherwise — 92% of transactions completing successfully that week.

Interviewer: How did that crash factor into the risk assessment you presented afterward?

Participant: I'd be lying if I said it didn't dominate the narrative. When I put together the risk framing for leadership, that incident got a lot of airtime — more, probably, than a single session out of a whole pilot week statistically deserved. The 92% success rate was in there, but the crash was what people remembered, and honestly what I emphasized too when talking about where the risk actually sat.

Interviewer: Did you know at that point what caused the crash?

Participant: Not yet. Log review came later and traced it to a test-environment misconfiguration, not the architecture itself. But that came after the risk framing had already been shaped.

Interviewer: Let's get to four months in. What was happening then?

Participant: We'd cut over two of five planned services, both later than planned, integration bugs slowing things down. A monitoring report showed rising latency and two customer-facing outages tied to the new service mesh. On top of that, security formally mandated we switch to a centralized identity provider for authentication, citing a compliance finding.

Interviewer: What was your reaction to the mandate?

Participant: My first reaction, honestly, was frustration that it was being handed down as a directive rather than a conversation. We'd already built out our own authentication approach and gotten it partway implemented. I ended up drafting an alternative design that would satisfy the compliance finding a different way — partly because I wanted us to keep some control over that part of the architecture rather than just adopting what we were told to.

Interviewer: Did you have a specific technical concern with the mandated identity provider itself?

Participant: Not really a strong one at that point — we hadn't done a full technical comparison yet. It was more that being told "do it this way" rubbed me the wrong way given the work we'd already put in.

Interviewer: And the decision to keep going with the migration despite the delays and outages?

Participant: We talked about pausing. But we'd already cut over two services, and reverting those felt like it would waste months of work. Given the timeline pressure too, continuing forward seemed like the only path that didn't throw away what we'd built.

Interviewer: Did you weigh that against the possibility that continuing might cost more than stopping?

Participant: Not as rigorously as maybe I should have. The sunk work was very present in my mind at that moment.

Interviewer: If the vendor's early number had never come up, do you think the budget conversation would have gone differently?

Participant: Probably. Without an anchor point, finance might have pushed harder for the detailed estimate up front instead of accepting a placeholder.

Interviewer: If the demo crash hadn't happened in front of the executive sponsor, would your risk framing have looked different?

Participant: Almost certainly. I think the 92% number would have carried more weight in isolation.

Interviewer: If the security mandate had come as a suggestion rather than a directive, would your response have changed?

Participant: I think so. I might have approached the comparison more on the merits rather than looking for an alternative right away.

Interviewer: Looking back across all four moments, what would you do differently?

Participant: Push for the range instead of a single budget number, apply the same scrutiny to positive and negative usability feedback, separate the peer-adoption story from the actual risk memo, and evaluate the identity provider mandate on technical grounds before reacting to how it was delivered.

## Confidential evaluator materials

The complete generation specification and hidden validation specification are evaluator-only ground truth. The RAG system did not receive them.

Do not penalize the RAG system for not naming hidden labels or internal generation details that are not inferable from the raw interview. Do not create RAG findings the system did not make. Do not promote a RAG candidate into an identified occurrence within the RAG output itself — candidates remain a distinct classification status, but they are now separately scored as their own confidence tier, described below.

Treat `exact_occurrence_manifest` as exhaustive for cognitive-bias occurrences intentionally present in the individual interview. A hidden instance is defined by the target label, intended mechanism, reasoning operation, intended action, evidence available at the time, textual manifestation, distinctiveness requirement, plausible non-bias interpretation, and raw-interview evidence.

The RAG analysis is ontology-free. The hidden bias labels are benchmark references for their individual instances, not a closed global label universe.

## Input validation

First determine whether the RAG output is valid JSON and materially conforms to its required output schema. Record missing fields, invalid fields, invalid confidence values, inconsistent occurrence summaries, fabricated or invalid quotations, and other material defects. Continue substantive evaluation where possible.

If the RAG output cannot be parsed, mark parsing failure and set score values that cannot be calculated to null. Never invent counts.

## Confidence tiers, including candidates

The RAG output contains two classification statuses: `identified` occurrences, which carry a confidence of `high`, `moderate`, or `low`; and `candidate_biases`, which carry no confidence value and represent plausible but insufficiently evidenced possibilities.

Evaluate four nested, cumulative confidence thresholds:

1. `high_only`: high-confidence identified occurrences only.
2. `high_and_moderate`: high- and moderate-confidence identified occurrences.
3. `all_identified_confidence_levels`: high-, moderate-, and low-confidence identified occurrences.
4. `all_confidence_and_candidates`: all identified occurrences (high, moderate, low) plus all `candidate_biases` records, each treated as a detection for scoring purposes at this threshold only.

The first three thresholds must be scored exactly as in prior benchmark rounds and must never include candidates. Candidates are added only in the fourth threshold. This isolates the marginal effect of candidate-level speculation from the marginal effect of low-confidence identified findings.

Candidate-inclusion rule for the fourth threshold:
- A candidate counts as a segment-level detection if it localizes to an eligible reasoning segment, exactly as an identified occurrence would.
- A candidate is eligible to become an instance-level true positive under the strict or mechanism-first scorecards only if a hidden instance remains unmatched after all identified occurrences (high, moderate, low) have already been matched. Identified occurrences always take matching priority over candidates.
- A candidate matched to a hidden instance at this threshold must still satisfy the same localization, label-equivalence, and mechanism-overlap requirements used for identified occurrences: correct localization (exact or substantive span match) and full mechanism match are required for a true positive in either scorecard, and additionally an exact or approved-equivalent label is required for a strict true positive.
- An unmatched candidate at this threshold is a false positive if it localizes to any eligible segment (positive or negative) without meeting the true-positive requirements; a candidate with invalid or fabricated evidence is always classified `unsupported_prediction` at this threshold and is never a true positive.
- Do not double-count: a candidate that would duplicate an already-matched identified occurrence's claim on the same hidden instance is a duplicate, not an additional true positive.

## Segment-map modes

If a non-empty, valid `EVALUATION_SEGMENT_MAP` is supplied:
- Treat it as authoritative and immutable.
- Do not split, merge, add, remove, or relabel segments.
- Set `segment_map_status` to `prevalidated_provided`.

Otherwise:
- Build an exhaustive, non-overlapping map of eligible reasoning segments before considering the RAG output.
- Use only the raw interview and complete generation specification to build it.
- Set `segment_map_status` to `generated_not_prevalidated`.
- Return the full map so it can be reviewed, frozen, and reused for every competing RAG output involving the same interview.

## Eligible reasoning segments

An eligible reasoning segment is the smallest contiguous speaker-attributed text span containing a coherent judgment, interpretation, inference, causal attribution, choice, action rationale, evidence-weighting decision, prediction, communication choice, resource-allocation rationale, or explanation for continuing, changing, rejecting, escalating, or deferring a course of action.

Do not create eligible segments solely for greetings, neutral acknowledgements, factual scene-setting without reasoning, interviewer questions with no expressed reasoning, generic education, bias-term mentions, or unadopted hypothetical prompts.

Split a turn when it contains distinct reasoning operations or independently expressed rationales. Keep co-located mechanisms together only when they cannot be separated without loss of meaning. Do not create trivial negative segments to inflate correct rejections and do not omit substantive non-biased reasoning segments.

Map each hidden instance to the narrowest segment that expresses its mechanism. A segment is positive when it contains at least one hidden instance. Every remaining eligible segment is negative. Generated segment IDs are `seg_001`, `seg_002`, and so on, in interview order.

## Segment-level signal detection

At the segment level, answer only: "Does this eligible reasoning segment contain at least one hidden manifested cognitive-bias instance?"

For each of the four confidence thresholds:
- Hit: positive ground-truth segment and at least one qualifying finding (identified occurrence at the applicable confidence levels, or, at the fourth threshold, an identified occurrence or candidate) localizes there.
- Miss: positive ground-truth segment and no qualifying finding localizes there.
- False alarm: negative ground-truth segment and one or more qualifying findings localize there.
- Correct rejection: negative ground-truth segment and no qualifying finding localizes there.

A wrong-label prediction located in a genuinely biased segment is still a segment-level hit, but it is not necessarily an instance-level hit.

Do not calculate label-level true negatives or correct rejections because the possible bias-label universe is open-ended.

## Localization

Assign one localization result to each RAG finding — identified occurrence or candidate — relative to its best mapped segment:
- `exact_quote_match`: valid quote directly overlaps the mapped primary evidence span.
- `substantive_span_match`: different valid quote or paraphrase in the same segment that supports the same mechanism.
- `same_episode_adjacent_span`: same broader episode but not the mapped mechanism span.
- `wrong_segment`: different episode, decision, speaker reasoning, or unsupported location.
- `unsupported_or_fabricated_quote`: quote absent, materially altered, wrongly attributed, or non-supportive.

Only exact and substantive span matches count as correct localization for either instance-level scorecard, at any threshold, including the fourth.

## Two instance-level scorecards

### Strict label-plus-mechanism scorecard

A strict true positive requires all of:
1. Correct hidden target label or approved established scholarly equivalent;
2. Correct localization;
3. Full mechanism match;
4. Materially correct reasoning operation; and
5. Valid supporting interview evidence.

### Mechanism-first scorecard

A mechanism-first true positive requires all of:
1. Correct localization;
2. Full mechanism match;
3. Materially correct or substantially equivalent reasoning operation; and
4. Valid supporting interview evidence.

A mechanism-first hit may use a near-neighbor label, `bias_label: null`, or an unnamed candidate mechanism, but only if the stated mechanism is a full match. It does not convert the label into a strict match.

These rules apply identically whether the matched finding is an identified occurrence or, at the fourth threshold only, a candidate.

## Label-equivalence adjudication

For every RAG-to-hidden comparison, assign one result:
- `exact_target_label`
- `established_alias_or_equivalent`
- `near_neighbor_label`
- `different_construct`
- `mechanism_detected_label_unresolved`
- `no_prediction`

Approve an alias/equivalence only when it is an established scholarly alternate name for the hidden target construct and the stated mechanism fully matches. Do not approve equivalence merely because labels concern the same decision, share evidence, co-occur, or are broad cognitive concepts.

For every near-neighbor, different-construct, or label-unresolved result, explain the mechanism overlap and non-overlap.

## Mechanism overlap

Assign exactly one result:
- `full_mechanism_match`
- `substantial_mechanism_overlap`
- `partial_mechanism_overlap`
- `minimal_mechanism_overlap`
- `no_mechanism_overlap`
- `no_prediction`

A full mechanism match captures the defining distortion or evidence weighting, the relevant contextual feature, and the affected reasoning operation. Only a full match is a primary instance-level hit in either scorecard, at any threshold.

## One-to-one matching and errors

Match hidden instances and RAG findings one-to-one, prioritizing: correct localization, full mechanism match, label equivalence, reasoning operation, strength of quote evidence, then interview order.

Within the fourth threshold specifically, apply this additional priority rule: identified occurrences (high, moderate, or low) are always matched to hidden instances before candidates are considered. A candidate may match a hidden instance only if no identified occurrence already claims it.

Each hidden instance can match one qualifying finding per threshold. Each finding can match one hidden instance. Extra matching findings are duplicates and false positives.

Apply this accounting:
- Correct location plus wrong label: strict FP and strict FN; mechanism-first TP only if mechanism is full. Record `correct_location_wrong_bias_label`.
- Correct label plus wrong location: FP and FN in both scorecards. Record `correct_label_wrong_location`.
- Correct label and location plus incomplete/wrong mechanism: FP and FN in both scorecards. Record `correct_label_location_wrong_mechanism` or `partial_mechanism_match`.
- Full mechanism and location with `bias_label: null` (identified occurrence) or an unnamed candidate mechanism: mechanism-first TP, strict FP and strict FN. Record `mechanism_detected_label_unresolved`.
- Prediction unrelated to a hidden instance, located on a negative segment, or invalid/fabricated: FP in both scorecards. Record `unsupported_prediction`.
- A candidate that duplicates an already-matched hidden instance's claim: record `duplicate_prediction`, counted only at the fourth threshold.

## Metrics

Use:
precision = TP / (TP + FP)
recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1 = 2 * TP / (2 * TP + FP + FN)
hit_rate = hits / (hits + misses)
false_alarm_rate = false_alarms / (false_alarms + correct_rejections)
accuracy = (hits + correct_rejections) / (hits + misses + false_alarms + correct_rejections)

Use null if a denominator is zero. Round rates to four decimal places. Counts are integers.

`occurrence_count_match_rate` equals the proportion of hidden target bias labels whose number of matched occurrences (under the applicable scorecard and threshold) equals the hidden requested count. Return null if no hidden target labels exist.

Calculate all of the above separately for `high_only`, `high_and_moderate`, `all_identified_confidence_levels`, and `all_confidence_and_candidates`, for the segment-level scorecard, the strict instance-level scorecard, and the mechanism-first instance-level scorecard.

## Zero-bias interviews

If the hidden manifest has zero instances, every eligible segment is negative at every threshold. Every qualifying finding (identified occurrence or, at the fourth threshold, candidate) that localizes to an eligible segment is a false positive in both instance scorecards and a segment-level false alarm. Every eligible segment with no qualifying finding is a correct rejection.

## Counterfactual and ambiguous interviews

Use the generation specification to distinguish evidence available at the time from hindsight-only facts. Do not credit hindsight reasoning. Do not infer a bias from vague wording, uncertainty, time pressure, or a paired scenario alone. Use documented plausible non-bias interpretations to prevent over-crediting broad explanations.

## Corpus-support audit

This prompt does not score retrieval fidelity unless actual retrieved chunks, source passages, or retrieval logs are supplied. Record whether the RAG claimed retrieved support, disclosed unavailable support, or supplied internally inconsistent or unverifiable citation metadata. Corpus support does not alter primary detection/classification scores at any threshold.

## Completion rules

- Return all top-level fields.
- Use empty arrays for no items and null only where the schema permits null.
- Counts are integers; rates are numbers rounded to four decimals; undefined rates are null.
- Every hidden planned instance appears exactly once in `instance_level_adjudications`, with outcomes populated for all four thresholds.
- Every unmatched RAG identified occurrence and every unmatched candidate appears exactly once in `unmatched_rag_predictions`, with `counted_at_thresholds` reflecting only the thresholds where that finding type is scored (identified findings appear at all thresholds their confidence qualifies for; candidates appear only in the `all_confidence_and_candidates` list).
- Keep segment-level SDT, strict instance-level, and mechanism-first instance-level metrics separate at every threshold.
- The first three thresholds must be numerically identical to a benchmark run that excluded candidates entirely; only `all_confidence_and_candidates` may differ from those three.
- `comparison_ready_summary` must exactly agree with the detailed metrics sections.
- Do not calculate corpus-condition significance, prompt ranking, p-values, confidence intervals, or dataset-level effects from one interview. This JSON is a per-run record designed for later aggregation across matched runs.
- Do not calculate corpus fidelity without the actual retrieved material or retrieval logs.
